## v1.60.0 (2026-04-29)
<!-- hero -->
Kit-write model committed to PR-only. The `guard_kit_writes` PreToolUse hook is refactored from a broad write-block (file-edit branch + redirect/tee/cd-and-commit Bash patterns) to a narrow destructive-only check (`rm -r*` of kit paths, `git push --force` to kit main from any cwd that mentions the kit OR is inside the kit). The canonical gate for kit changes is the kit's `.githooks/pre-commit` 'no direct-to-main' hook plus PR review -- the same model every shared repo uses. Empirical basis for the shift: 8 minor releases (v1.51 - v1.58) shipped with `guard_kit_writes` matchers in lowercase form that never fired on real Tool calls; during that window multiple consuming projects pulled the kit and edited kit working trees freely with zero corruption incidents documented. Once v1.59.0 fixed the matchers, the guard's dominant effect was a long tail of false positives on legitimate Bash commands whose source bytes happened to contain a kit-path token (heredoc bodies, JSON payloads, `python3 -c` quoted code, `cd kit && git describe`). `protect_directives.py` ships a parallel tightening: the overbroad `python3 -c "...directives/..."` Bash pattern is retired -- it matched ANY Python one-liner that referenced `directives/`, including read-only and data-only references, with a false-positive rate that made `python3 -c` near-unusable from Claude Code (3 false-positive blocks during the v1.59.1 patch session alone). The narrow bypass route the pattern closed is theoretical; in practice writes go through Edit/Write/MultiEdit (file-path branch, still active and existence-aware) or the other Bash patterns (>, >>, tee, sed, awk, rm, mv, cp -- still covered). `directives/starter-kit-sync.md` gains a new `### Step 0.5: Verify kit working tree is clean (mandatory pre-flight)` that catches the dominant residual exposure of the new model: cross-project AI edits to the kit working tree that go silent until the next sync. `directives/kit-development.md` adds a `## Kit-write model: PR-only` section codifying the empirical basis, the canonical gate, the SKIP_KIT_GUARD escape valve, and the cross-project exposure mitigation. `directives/delivery-rules.md`, kit's `CLAUDE.md`, and the migration manifest `migrations/v1.60.0.md` cover the prose updates. New pytest coverage in `tests/claude_hooks/` (32 tests) locks both hooks' contracts so future changes can't silently regress -- the kit's existing test surface had no coverage for `.claude/hooks/` until now. Net effect: strictly stronger protection on irreversible operations (rm-r and force-push were silently or partially allowed in the OLD guard), weaker protection on accidental edits at the PreToolUse layer (mitigated by the new dirty-tree pre-flight + PR review), and the long false-positive tail closed.
<!-- /hero -->

### Added
- **`directives/kit-development.md` `## Kit-write model: PR-only`** -- new section codifying the v1.60.0 model. Names the canonical gate (`.githooks/pre-commit` + PR review), the empirical basis (8 silent-guard releases, zero corruption), the SKIP_KIT_GUARD escape valve, and the cross-project exposure that the dirty-tree pre-flight is designed to catch.
- **`directives/starter-kit-sync.md` `### Step 0.5: Verify kit working tree is clean`** -- new mandatory pre-flight in `/sync-doe`. If `cd ~/doe-starter-kit && git status --porcelain` is non-empty at sync entry, the procedure stops and surfaces every dirty path with its diff. The user decides whether changes are intended (continue) or accidental (revert + retry).
- **`directives/starter-kit-sync.md` `## How to Sync` framing** -- one-line clarification that `/sync-doe` is the project-to-kit translation tooling, not the canonical write gate.
- **`migrations/v1.60.0.md`** -- migration manifest with OLD/NEW/WHY phrase pairs for the affected directives, behavioural-change records for both hooks (with paste-ready `Pull-impact grep:` commands), and a customised-directive 3-way-merge note for downstream projects.
- **`tests/claude_hooks/__init__.py` + `test_guard_kit_writes.py` + `test_protect_directives.py`** -- 32 pytest tests covering both hooks. Pattern mirrors `tests/githooks/test_pre_commit.py` (subprocess-driven hook invocation, JSON stdin payloads). Locks the v1.60.0 contract; future regressions on the destructive-only gate, the file-edit-allows behaviour, the existence-aware directives block, the python3-c-allows behaviour, and the SKIP_KIT_GUARD escape valve will fail loudly.
- **kit's `CLAUDE.md` ## Gotchas** -- new `**Kit-write model:**` bullet referencing the PR-only model and pointing to `directives/kit-development.md` for the full spec.

### Changed
- **`.claude/hooks/guard_kit_writes.py`** -- file-edit branch (Edit/Write/MultiEdit on kit paths) removed; `cp`/`mv`/`cd-and-commit`/`>`/`>>`/`tee` Bash patterns removed; `rm -r*` of kit paths newly blocked; `git push --force` to kit main (mentioning kit path OR from kit cwd) newly blocked; `FLAG_FILE` (`.tmp/.sync-doe-active`) bypass removed; cwd-aware logic kept only as a helper for force-push detection (no longer a top-level allow-early-return). Strictly stronger protection on irreversible ops; weaker protection on accidental edits at the PreToolUse layer.
- **`.claude/hooks/protect_directives.py`** -- overbroad `python3 -c "[..]directives/[..]"` Bash pattern removed. Read-only and data-only Python one-liners that reference `directives/` no longer trip a false positive. The other 8 Bash patterns (>, >>, tee, sed -i, awk -i inplace, rm, mv, cp) and the existence-aware file-path branch are unchanged.
- **`directives/delivery-rules.md`** -- `## Guardrails` `Kit edits go through ...` bullet rewritten to name `.githooks/pre-commit` + PR review as the canonical gate and `/sync-doe` as the translation tooling.

### Pull impact
Projects on v1.59.x will see their `.claude/hooks/guard_kit_writes.py` mirror simplify dramatically (file-edit branch gone, FLAG_FILE removed, fewer Bash patterns, two new destructive checks added). Their `.claude/hooks/protect_directives.py` mirror loses one Bash pattern. Their `directives/delivery-rules.md` mirror gets one bullet rewritten. Their `directives/kit-development.md` and `directives/starter-kit-sync.md` mirrors gain new sections. Their `CLAUDE.md` (if customised from kit) gains a Gotcha bullet.

The dominant new exposure for project AI: kit working-tree edits no longer fire a PreToolUse block. The dominant new defence: `/sync-doe` Step 0.5 dirty-tree pre-flight + PR review. Run `/pull-doe` to see per-file impact for your project before applying the pull; the new manifest at `migrations/v1.60.0.md` carries the OLD/NEW/WHY pairs and the paste-ready `Pull-impact grep:` commands.

## v1.59.1 (2026-04-29)
<!-- hero -->
Hook hygiene patch closing two LOW findings (conf 80 + 85) from the monty-side `/review` of v1.59.0. `protect_directives.py` now allows Writes that create a brand-new directive (e.g. during a kit retro) -- the docstring promised this behaviour but the code unconditionally blocked any Edit/Write whose path contained `directives/`, regardless of whether the file existed. The fix adds a `Path(path).exists()` check in the `WRITE_TOOLS` branch so only edits to already-tracked files trigger the guard. `guard_kit_writes.py` tightens the `>`, `>>`, and `tee` patterns in `KIT_BASH_PATTERNS` to require the kit path to follow the operator with no Bash word-boundary chars (`\s\'"|;&<>`) in between -- previously the greedy `>\s*.*doe-starter-kit` and `tee\s.*doe-starter-kit` patterns would match any same-line mention of the kit path, so a heredoc body, JSON payload, or downstream string referencing the kit (e.g. `cat > /tmp/foo.json <<EOF { "p": "~/doe-starter-kit/x" } EOF`) would trip the guard even though the actual redirect target was `/tmp`. An explicit `>>` pattern is added so append-redirect protection does not regress (the new tightened character class excludes `>`, where the old greedy pattern happened to swallow `>>` via the second `>`). The same hook gains a third early-return: when `os.getcwd()` resolves (via `realpath`) to the kit directory or anywhere below it, the guard returns `allow` without scanning -- the kit's `.githooks/pre-commit` 'no direct-to-main' hook plus PR review are the canonical gate when working on kit features from inside the kit dir, and the file-level guard becomes performative there. From outside the kit, the guard's full behaviour is preserved. Pure bug-fix release; no migration manifest.
<!-- /hero -->

### Fixed
- **`.claude/hooks/protect_directives.py`** -- `WRITE_TOOLS` branch added a `Path(path).exists()` check. New directive files now pass through (the docstring's stated behaviour); edits to existing files in `directives/` or `.githooks/` still block. Bash branch unchanged -- new-vs-existing detection on Bash arguments is a heuristic loss, so block-all-on-`directives/` stays the safe default there.
- **`.claude/hooks/guard_kit_writes.py`** -- `>`, `>>`, and `tee` patterns in `KIT_BASH_PATTERNS` tightened to `>\|?\s*[\'"]?[^\s\'"|;&<>]*doe-starter-kit`, `>>\s*[\'"]?[^\s\'"|;&<>]*doe-starter-kit`, and `\btee\s+(?:-a\s+)?[^\s|;&]*doe-starter-kit`. The kit path must follow the operator with no Bash word-boundary chars in between, eliminating the heredoc-body / JSON-payload false-positive class. Explicit `>>` pattern added so append-redirect protection does not regress.

### Changed
- **`.claude/hooks/guard_kit_writes.py`** -- third early-return added after `SKIP_KIT_GUARD` and `FLAG_FILE`. When `os.getcwd()` (resolved via `realpath`) sits at or below `KIT_DIR`, the hook allows immediately. From outside the kit, the guard's full behaviour is preserved. Removes the friction of working ON kit features (e.g. on a kit feature branch) where the kit's `.githooks/pre-commit` 'no direct-to-main' hook plus PR review are the canonical gate; the file-level guard becomes performative when cwd is the kit. Paves the way for the v1.60.0 PR-only refactor of `guard_kit_writes`.

### Pull impact
None -- pure bug-fix release with no rule semantics or phrase changes. Projects on v1.59.0 will see fewer false-positive guard blocks and gain the ability to create new directive files via `Write` without ceremony. No `/pull-doe` migration manifest needed.

---

## v1.59.0 (2026-04-29)
<!-- hero -->
Pink Elephant rewrite. Load-bearing prohibitions across the kit's prompt surface ("Never X", "Don't Y", "DO NOT Z") have been rewritten to positive "When X, do Y" form per the Pink Elephant article (arxiv 2503.22395) and IFEval/InFoBench evidence -- prohibitions re-activate the forbidden concept and CAPS-LOCK amplifies the effect, so the kit now leads with what to do instead, naming the safe API or the legitimate workflow alongside each rule. 25 of 26 flat directives gained a `Tradeoff:` line capturing when the rule earns its cost vs when it's overhead. The release also fixes a silently-broken hook matcher: PreToolUse and PostToolUse entries in `.claude/settings.json` shipped with lowercase piped patterns (`write|create|edit`, `bash`, `read`) that did NOT match Claude Code's actual Tool name strings, so every kit hook had been quietly non-functional since introduction; matchers are now case-sensitive Tool names (`Edit|Write|MultiEdit`, `Bash`, `Read`) and the hooks fire as designed. The Pink Elephant article's "routable via Bash" finding is closed in the same commit cluster: `protect_directives.py` and `block_secrets_in_code.py` are extended to the `Bash` matcher and parse redirected writes (`cat >`, `tee`, `sed -i`, `>>`) so a model that reaches for Bash to bypass the file-edit hooks lands on the same wall. The pull impact for projects on v1.58.0 or earlier is non-trivial -- their hooks have been silently bypassed for the kit's full hook history, and pulling v1.59.0 will start firing kit-write blocks, secret-detection blocks, plan-copy automation, completed-feature warnings, and plan-freshness reads they never observed. None of these change rule semantics; they enforce existing rules that were silently bypassed. The new `migrations/v1.59.0.md` manifest carries 150 OLD/NEW/WHY phrase pairs across 33 files plus four behavioural-change records with paste-ready `Pull-impact grep:` commands, and a new `/pull-doe` pre-flight phase (Step 4.5) consumes the manifest so every project pulling the release sees a "PULL IMPACT" panel listing every retired phrase its files still reference and every workflow that may newly trip a hook. The migration manifest format is documented in `directives/starter-kit-sync.md` (new Step 9.5) for use by future kit releases.
<!-- /hero -->

### Added
- **migrations/v1.59.0.md** -- new migration manifest format for kit releases that rewrite phrasing or change hook/permission behaviour. 150 OLD/NEW/WHY phrase pairs across 33 files (Tier 1: CLAUDE.md + universal template; Tier 2: 26 flat directives + 9 nested; Tier 3: kit's learnings.md), four behavioural-change records (matcher casing fix, `.env` Read deny, `protect_directives` bash extension, `block_secrets_in_code` bash extension), and a customised-directive 3-way-merge check.
- **directives/starter-kit-pull.md** -- new Step 4.5 "Pull-impact pre-flight (migration manifests)". Reads every manifest in the version range being pulled, greps the project for each `OLD:` phrase, runs the documented `Pull-impact grep:` command for each behavioural change, and surfaces the findings in the Step 12 Analysis Box before any change is applied.
- **directives/starter-kit-sync.md** -- new Step 9.5 "Author a migration manifest" documenting the OLD/NEW/WHY format, behavioural-change record shape, customised-directive check, authoring rules (one manifest per release, line-start OLD/NEW for greppability, `Pull-impact grep:` is paste-ready), and the narrow cases where no manifest is needed (additive-only or pure-bug-fix releases).
- **`.claude/settings.json`** `permissions.deny` entries for `Read(.env)`, `Read(./.env)`, `Read(./**/.env)`, `Read(.env.*)`, `Read(./**/.env.*)` -- tool-layer permission denial complements the existing PreToolUse hook by gating the read before the file is opened.
- **`Tradeoff:` line on 25 of 26 flat directives** -- one-line summary per directive of when the rule earns its cost vs when it's overhead. `_TEMPLATE.md` is intentionally exempt (audit-clean stub).
- **`directives/data-compliance.md` `## Placeholder Pattern for Shared Secrets`** -- documents the placeholder convention (`<API_KEY>`, `<DB_URL>`) for sharing example secrets in code, docs, tickets, and commit messages without tripping `block_secrets_in_code.py`.

### Changed
- **`.claude/settings.json` PreToolUse + PostToolUse matchers** -- lowercase piped patterns (`write|create|edit`, `bash`, `read`) replaced with case-sensitive Tool name strings (`Edit|Write|MultiEdit`, `Bash`, `Read`). Six PreToolUse hooks (`protect_directives`, `block_secrets_in_code`, `guard_kit_writes`, `block_dangerous_commands`, `enforce_review_gate`, `confirm_pr_merge`) and three PostToolUse hooks (`copy_plan_to_project`, `check_completed_feature`, `check_plan_freshness_hook`) now fire on real tool calls.
- **`protect_directives.py`** -- extended to the `Bash` matcher with regex coverage for `cat >`, `>>`, `tee`, `sed -i`, `awk -i inplace`, `rm`, `mv`, `cp`, `python -c "...directives/..."` patterns. Tool-name comparison fixed from lowercase (`tool_name in ("write", "edit")`) to case-sensitive (`tool_name in ("Write", "Edit", "MultiEdit")`).
- **`block_secrets_in_code.py`** -- extended to the `Bash` matcher with two checks: writes targeting any `.env.*` variant are blocked outright (regardless of content), and redirected writes containing secret-shaped tokens (`sk-...`, `ghp_...`, JWT, etc.) are blocked. Tool-name comparison fixed to case-sensitive.
- **CLAUDE.md (kit's own)** -- 7 phrase rewrites in Architecture, Core Behaviour, and Gotchas sections. Negations replaced with positive forms naming the action.
- **universal-claude-md-template.md** -- 7 phrase rewrites plus new `## Grammar` and `## Canary` sections. Grammar names the positive-form convention and cites the Pink Elephant evidence; Canary holds three leading-indicator rules (British English / cite directives by file path / Unicode borders + ASCII inside) for future audit hooks.
- **26 flat directives + 9 nested directives** -- ~150 negation phrases rewritten to positive form. Each rewrite names the safe API, the legitimate workflow, or the closed set of allowed values rather than enumerating prohibitions.
- **`directives/starter-kit-pull.md` Step 4** -- continuation pointer changed from "continue to Step 5" to "continue to Step 5" via Step 4.5.
- **kit's `learnings.md` `## Considered & Rejected` section** -- two decoration negations cleaned up.

### Fixed
- **PreToolUse and PostToolUse hooks** -- silent non-functioning since introduction. The lowercase matchers (`write|create|edit`, `bash`, `read`) never matched Claude Code's actual Tool name strings (`Write`, `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, `Bash`, `Read`), so every hook script registered in `.claude/settings.json` was a no-op. Confirmed empirically: Anthropic's official `security-guidance` plugin uses `"matcher": "Edit|Write|MultiEdit"` and DID fire on Write events; kit hooks with the lowercase form did NOT. Manual stdin tests proved the hook scripts work when invoked -- the matcher pattern was the gap.
- **Pink Elephant "routable via Bash" finding** -- prior to v1.59.0, `protect_directives.py` and `block_secrets_in_code.py` were registered only on the `write|create|edit` matcher. A model following a "don't write secrets" prompt could satisfy a write request via `Bash(cat > path/with/secret …)` and bypass the hook. Both hooks now run on the `Bash` matcher with command-string parsing and block the bypass.
- **Hook tool-name comparisons in `protect_directives.py` and `block_secrets_in_code.py`** -- previously compared `tool_name` to lowercase strings (`"write"`, `"edit"`), which would have failed even after the matcher casing fix. Now case-sensitive (`"Write"`, `"Edit"`, `"MultiEdit"`, `"Bash"`).

### Pull impact
Projects on v1.58.0 or earlier should expect:
1. Kit hooks start firing on real tool calls -- kit-write blocks, secret-detection blocks (now also from Bash), plan-copy automation, completed-feature warnings, plan-freshness reads.
2. Phrase rewrites in CLAUDE.md, universal template, and directives. Project files that copied verbatim from kit phrasing will diverge -- the `/pull-doe` pre-flight (Step 4.5) flags every retired phrase the project still references and points to the replacement.
3. `Read(.env)` is denied at the permission layer. Project workflows that read `.env` via Claude tools should switch to a documented loader (a script that reads the file and returns parsed values) -- the migration manifest documents the grep that finds at-risk references.

Run `/pull-doe` to see the per-file impact for your project before applying the pull.

## v1.58.0 (2026-04-27)
<!-- hero -->
Tested code and tutorial docs now have freshness guardrails. Two warning-only blocks added to `.githooks/pre-commit` flag commits where a tested source file is staged without its sibling test (`execution/doe_init.py`, `.githooks/pre-commit`, `.githooks/commit-msg`) and where source files ship without their tutorial-doc counterpart (`global-commands/*.md` -> `docs/tutorial/commands.html`, `.githooks/*` -> `docs/tutorial/hooks.md`). Both warnings name the missing path so the fix is one ack-and-add away. Neither blocks the commit -- they're nudges, not gates. The directive layer (`directives/testing-strategy.md` ## Maintenance, new in this release) is the source of truth that says tests are required when modifying tested code; the hook is a forgetful-human safety net. The companion manifest trigger broadens from "Testing setup / strategy" to "Testing setup / strategy / Modifying tested code" so the directive loads on edits to tested code, not just initial setup. Skip with `SKIP_TEST_FRESHNESS=1` or `SKIP_DOC_FRESHNESS=1`. Reference-section regeneration (auto-rewriting tutorial prose) is explicitly out of scope -- staleness is now visible; closing the gap stays a human decision.
<!-- /hero -->

### Added
- **directives/testing-strategy.md** -- new `## Maintenance` section covering the freshness loop for tested code. Names the kit's tested surfaces (`execution/*.py`, `.githooks/*`), the update-vs-add-test choice when modifying covered code, the rule for reviewing existing `[manual]` contracts by hand when a new auto tool ships (review and promote, don't build a generic auto-promotion engine), and a doc-freshness counterpart that mirrors the new pre-commit warnings.
- **.githooks/pre-commit** -- two warning-only blocks at end of the hook. Test freshness: warns when staged `execution/doe_init.py`, `.githooks/pre-commit`, or `.githooks/commit-msg` ships without its sibling test under `tests/`. Doc freshness: warns when staged `global-commands/*.md` ships without `docs/tutorial/commands.html`, or `.githooks/*` ships without `docs/tutorial/hooks.md`. Both blocks bound by `# ---` markers so contract verify-patterns can isolate them.
- **manifest.json** -- `testing-strategy.md` trigger broadened from "Testing setup / strategy" to "Testing setup / strategy / Modifying tested code" so generated CLAUDE.md trigger tables surface the directive on edits, not just initial test setup.
- **tests/githooks/test_pre_commit.py** -- seven new pytest tests exercising the freshness blocks against fresh tmpdir repos: `test_test_freshness_warn`, `test_test_freshness_silent_when_test_staged`, `test_test_freshness_silent_for_unrelated`, `test_doc_freshness_commands_warn`, `test_doc_freshness_hooks_warn`, `test_doc_freshness_silent_when_doc_staged`, `test_doc_freshness_silent_for_unrelated`. Each inits a repo on main, takes the allowed first commit, switches to a feature branch, then asserts the warn-and-still-pass behaviour. Reusable `_init_repo_on_feature_branch` helper.
- **tests/execution/test_doe_init.py** -- `test_trigger_phrase_in_claude_md` covers the trigger-phrase flow through `generate_claude_md` so a future narrowing of the manifest entry fails loudly.
- **docs/tutorial/hooks.md** -- pre-commit section updated to document the two new freshness blocks and the `SKIP_TEST_FRESHNESS` / `SKIP_DOC_FRESHNESS` env vars.

### Changed
- Pytest suite grows from 89 (v1.57.0) to 97. Seven new freshness tests sit alongside the four commit-msg tests and the original two main-branch-protection tests.
- `manifest.json` trigger row for `testing-strategy.md` now reads "Testing setup / strategy / Modifying tested code" -- strictly broader, no removed coverage.

### Out of scope (not shipped, intentional)
- LLM-based or scripted tutorial-doc regeneration. The kit's position: surface staleness, leave the rewrite to humans. A reference-section regeneration script can land as a separate FR if the manual approach proves insufficient.
- Hook block-mode flip. Both new checks are `warn`-only with no env var to escalate; the kit-development directive's hook design rule (under ~1s, warn when uncertain) keeps these advisory.

## v1.57.0 (2026-04-27)
<!-- hero -->
Phase 1 of adopting Conventional Commits across the DOE kit. Two new directives, one extended commit-msg hook, a CLAUDE.md template section, five command/directive migrations, and four tutorial doc updates — bundled so that downstream projects bootstrap with the convention from session zero. The new `commit-msg` validator runs in `warn` mode by default during the v1.57.0 -> v1.58.x transition window: non-compliant subjects print a one-line warning to stderr but the commit still succeeds. Set `DOE_COMMIT_HOOK_MODE=block` once your team is fully on the convention. Allowlisted bypass patterns (`Merge`, `Revert "`, `Initial commit`, `fixup!`, `squash!`, legacy `vX.Y.Z:`) keep merge commits, reverts, and pre-v1.57.0 release history flowing untouched. Phase 2 (auto-changelog generator, hook block-mode default, PR-title GitHub Action) is deferred to a future session. Resolves Phase 1 of #17 and closes #13 (stale `.claude/commands/README.md` reference in `starter-kit-sync.md`).
<!-- /hero -->

### Added
- **directives/git-conventions.md** — the kit's source of truth for Conventional Commits 1.0. Covers all 10 type prefixes (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`, `build`, `ci`, `style`), the breaking-change `!` suffix, the kit's six-pattern allowlist with rationale per entry, the `DOE_COMMIT_HOOK_MODE` env var, and DOE-grounded worked examples covering releases (`chore(release): vX.Y.Z`), feature work, bug fixes, docs, and dependency bumps. Includes a migration note explaining why we don't rewrite legacy `vX.Y.Z:` history.
- **directives/kit-development.md** — kit-only contributor conventions distinct from the per-project conventions. Codifies the versioning model (one shared release per PR — all steps ship together, not one patch per step), branch naming (`feature/<name>-vX.Y.Z`, `fix/vX.Y.Z-<name>`, `housekeeping/<name>`), CHANGELOG hero/Added/Changed/Fixed structure, release mechanics (manual tag + `gh release create` after PR merge, notes extracted from CHANGELOG hero), the CC self-dogfood expectation, the tests-included-by-default expectation (cross-references `testing-strategy.md`), and the hook-design rule that pre-commit hooks must stay under ~1s — slow checks belong in slash commands.
- **.githooks/commit-msg** — Conventional Commits validation stage between the existing co-author trailer strip and the changelog/step-mark enforcers. Subject must match `<type>[(scope)][!]: <description>`. Six allowlist patterns bypass validation. Mode controlled by `DOE_COMMIT_HOOK_MODE` (default `warn`, switch to `block` for hard enforcement). Skip the entire commit-msg hook with `git commit --no-verify`.
- **templates/_base/claude_sections/17_git_conventions.md** — new section inserted between `15_commands.md` and `20_structure.md` in `generate_claude_md()`. Lists all 10 type prefixes, names the allowlist patterns, documents the `DOE_COMMIT_HOOK_MODE` env var, and references `directives/git-conventions.md` for the full spec. Bootstrapped projects see the convention from session zero.
- **docs/tutorial/hooks.md** — single-page tour of the kit's three git hooks (pre-commit, commit-msg, pre-push). Documents every check stage including the new CC validator, the targeted-skip-vs-`--no-verify` distinction, and the kit's hook-design rule. Will be referenced by v1.58.0's doc-freshness pre-commit hook.
- **tests/githooks/test_commit_msg.py** — four pytest tests driving the real hook against a temp file: `test_compliant`, `test_warn_mode`, `test_block_mode`, `test_allowlist` (covers all six bypass patterns).
- **tests/execution/test_doe_init.py** — `test_claude_md_has_git_conventions` asserts the generated CLAUDE.md contains the section header, every type prefix, the env var, and the directive reference.
- **manifest.json** — both new directives registered in `layers.universal.directives`. Two new trigger entries: "Writing a commit message" -> `git-conventions.md`, "Contributing to the DOE kit" -> `kit-development.md`. Generated CLAUDE.md trigger tables surface both.

### Changed
- **global-commands/sync-doe.md** — release commit format moves from `v[X.Y.Z]: Sync from [project]` to `chore(release): v[X.Y.Z] — sync from [project] ([summary])`. The new format threads through the legacy `vX.Y.Z:` allowlist so historical commits remain valid; new commits use the Conventional Commits prefix.
- **directives/starter-kit-sync.md** — same `chore(release):` release format. Also drops the stale `.claude/commands/README.md` reference (closes #13); the kit's authoritative command index is `global-commands/README.md` alone — projects no longer carry their own copy.
- **global-commands/agent-verify.md** — verification fix commit format moves from `fix: verification failure in [criterion]` to `fix(verify): [criterion] — [what was wrong]`. Same intent, Conventional Commits format with explicit scope.
- **global-commands/wrap.md** — commit classification reads CC prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `test:`) instead of the previous "Fix" / "fix:" string-prefix check. Added explicit fallback for legacy commits so historical wraps still classify correctly.
- **directives/building-rules.md** — new "Use Conventional Commits format" bullet under Branch & Commit Discipline pointing at the spec, the allowlist, and the `DOE_COMMIT_HOOK_MODE` env var.
- **execution/doe_init.py** `generate_claude_md()` — reads the new `17_git_conventions.md` section file (skipping silently if absent for back-compat with older kit checkouts).
- **docs/tutorial/commands.html** — `/agent-verify` section shows the `fix(verify):` commit format with a link to the new `hooks.md`.
- **docs/tutorial/tips-and-mistakes.html** — new "Use Conventional Commits for subjects" Do-card with worked examples.
- **docs/tutorial/faq.html** — new "What's the deal with the Conventional Commits warning?" accordion entry explaining warn-vs-block mode.

## v1.56.1 (2026-04-27)
<!-- hero -->
Patch release fixing three spec deviations that slipped into v1.56.0 against the original feature requests in kit issues #15 and #16. The auto-commit message now stamps the kit release that produced it (`chore: initial DOE scaffolding (kit vX.Y.Z)`) — a one-liner audit trail recoverable from `git log` alone, no `.doe-version` lookup needed. The `.env` bootstrap now refuses to create the secrets file unless `.gitignore` actively excludes `.env` (or matches `.env*`); the kit's standard `.gitignore` template ships with this rule, but the safety check defends against users who've stripped it out — better to skip with a warning than create an ungitignored secrets file. The bootstrap confirmation now appends "fill in values before running" both in the printed line and as a second row in the GIT+CI card, guiding users to populate the new `.env` before running anything. End-to-end wizard runs verified both positive (kit version stamped, hint printed) and negative (sabotaged `.gitignore` skips with warning) paths.
<!-- /hero -->

### Added
- **execution/doe_init.py** — `_gitignore_excludes_env(path)` helper that parses `.gitignore` entries, matches `.env` (literal) and `.env*` (glob), and correctly ignores comments, blank lines, and negation rules (`!.env` is NOT counted as exclusion).
- **tests/execution/test_doe_init.py** — eight new tests: `test_auto_commit_includes_kit_version_when_provided`, `test_auto_commit_omits_kit_version_when_not_provided`, `test_setup_passes_kit_version_to_auto_commit`, `test_env_bootstrap_skips_when_gitignore_missing`, `test_env_bootstrap_skips_when_gitignore_lacks_env_entry`, `test_env_bootstrap_proceeds_when_gitignore_excludes_env`, `test_env_bootstrap_proceeds_when_gitignore_uses_glob`, `test_env_bootstrap_treats_negation_as_no_match`.

### Changed
- **execution/doe_init.py** `maybe_auto_commit(project_dir, accept=None, kit_version=None)` — new `kit_version` kwarg. When provided, commit subject becomes `chore: initial DOE scaffolding (kit vX.Y.Z)`; when None, falls back to `chore: initial DOE scaffolding` (back-compat for existing tests/callers). Resolves the #15 spec deviation that omitted kit version stamping.
- **execution/doe_init.py** `setup_ci_git_collaboration` — wires `kit_version=get_kit_version(kit_dir)` into the `maybe_auto_commit` call.
- **execution/doe_init.py** `maybe_bootstrap_env` — checks `.gitignore` excludes `.env` before prompting. Skips with `Skipping .env bootstrap: .gitignore missing or doesn't exclude .env.` when the rule is absent. Confirmation line now reads `.env created from .env.example (fill in values before running)`. The GIT+CI card adds a second row (`fill in values before running`) below the existing `.env created from .env.example` row.
- **tests/execution/test_doe_init.py** — `test_env_bootstrap_creates` now provisions a `.gitignore` and asserts the hint substring in stdout. Source-level invariant tests (`test_auto_commit_before_hooks_activation`, `test_normalise_branch_called_before_auto_commit`) match call sites by function name only, so future kwarg additions don't break them.

## v1.56.0 (2026-04-27)
<!-- hero -->
Collapses four manual post-setup steps into opt-in wizard prompts so `bash ~/doe-starter-kit/setup.sh` leaves a fresh project ready for `gh repo create` with no workarounds. Part A: after `git init`, the wizard now offers to create a `chore: initial DOE scaffolding` commit (pre-checks `user.email` and skips with guidance if unset; commit lands *before* `core.hooksPath` is activated so pre-commit checks don't fire on the scaffolding commit). Part B: if `.env.example` was installed, the wizard offers to copy it to `.env` for local dev (never clobbers an existing `.env`). Part C: the pre-commit main-branch protection hook now allows the first-ever commit on main (when HEAD doesn't yet exist); every subsequent commit on main is still blocked. Part D: the wizard normalises the project branch to `main` before the scaffolding commit lands — fresh `git init` repos with HEAD on `master` get a `git symbolic-ref` to `refs/heads/main` (no commits to move), existing repos with local-only `master` get renamed via `git branch -m`, and `master` branches with upstream tracking are flagged with a warning row instead of being touched (avoiding remote side-effects). Resolves #19 (supersedes #15, #16, #18).
<!-- /hero -->

### Added
- **execution/doe_init.py** — `maybe_auto_commit(project_dir, accept=None)` helper that runs between `git init` and `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`. Pre-checks `user.email`, prompts the user, runs `git add -A && git commit -m "chore: initial DOE scaffolding"`, and surfaces the short SHA in the `GIT + CI` card. Skips cleanly when email is unset or the user declines.
- **execution/doe_init.py** — `maybe_bootstrap_env(project_dir, accept=None)` helper called at the start of `setup_ci_git_collaboration`. Skips silently if `.env.example` is missing; prints `.env already exists -- not overwriting.` and skips if `.env` already exists; otherwise prompts, copies, and surfaces `.env created from .env.example` in the `GIT + CI` card.
- **execution/doe_init.py** — `maybe_normalise_branch(project_dir)` helper. Handles four states: unborn HEAD on `master` -> `git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/main`; `master` with commits and no upstream -> `git branch -m master main`; already on `main` (or any non-master branch) -> no-op; `master` with upstream tracking -> returns a warning string for the card and leaves the branch untouched (renaming would orphan upstream tracking and require a force-push). Wired into `setup_ci_git_collaboration` between `git init` and `maybe_auto_commit` so the scaffolding commit lands on `main`. Card now shows `Renamed master -> main` or `! branch 'master' has upstream -- rename manually` when relevant.
- **tests/githooks/test_pre_commit.py** — new test module. `test_first_commit_allowed` and `test_second_commit_blocked` copy the real `.githooks/pre-commit` into an isolated tmpdir repo, stub `execution/audit_claims.py` to exit 0, skip downstream hook stages via env vars, and assert the main-protection block's exact before/after behaviour.
- **tests/execution/test_doe_init.py** — new test module with 10 tests: `.env` bootstrap creates/preserves/skips paths; auto-commit skips when `user.email` is unset; branch normalisation covers unborn-HEAD-on-master, local-master-with-commits, already-on-main, and master-with-upstream-warns; plus two source-level invariant tests asserting that `maybe_auto_commit` runs before `core.hooksPath` activation and that `maybe_normalise_branch` runs before `maybe_auto_commit` (guards against future refactors reordering them).

### Changed
- **.githooks/pre-commit** — main-branch protection now bypasses when `git rev-parse HEAD` fails (no commits yet). Fresh repo bootstrap lands the initial commit on main without `SKIP_MAIN_PROTECTION=1`; every subsequent commit on main still hits the block-direct-commits branch. Preserves the existing merge-commit exemption and all downstream hook stages.
- **execution/doe_init.py** `setup_ci_git_collaboration` — wires the three new helpers into the existing flow. Part B (`.env` bootstrap) runs at the top, before `.github/` copy. Part D (branch normalisation) runs after `git init` and before Part A. Part A (auto-commit) runs between branch normalisation and `git config core.hooksPath`; the GIT + CI card shows `.env created from .env.example`, `Renamed master -> main` (or the upstream-warn variant), and `Initial scaffolding commit -> <sha>` lines when the user accepts.

### Fixed
- **.githooks/pre-push** — the tutorial-docs version gate now enforces on `main`/`master` only. Previously it fired on every branch, blocking legitimate feature-branch PRs that bump docs ahead of their release tag (the tag is cut post-merge, not pre-PR). The methodology `--quick` check still runs on every push. Covered by `tests/githooks/test_pre_push.py` — `test_docs_gate_blocks_on_main` and `test_docs_gate_skipped_on_feature_branch`.
- **tests/execution/test_wrap_stats.py** — the four `test_compute_streak_*` tests called `compute_streak(stats)` with the old signature; `compute_streak` now requires a `session_date_str` argument (added when wrap_stats switched to commit-based session dating). Tests now pass a fixed `2026-04-23` date plus a yesterday fixture, removing dependence on `datetime.now()`.

## v1.55.11 (2026-04-21)
<!-- hero -->
Codifies two gotchas surfaced during the v1.55.10 sync: the Bash pipe-exit-code trap (`cmd | tail -N && side_effect` fires the side effect even when `cmd` fails, because `tail` exits 0), and the `SKIP_MAIN_PROTECTION=1` requirement on the kit-sync commit and push. Adds the pipe-exit rule to `universal-claude-md-template.md` ## Shell & Platform so new DOE projects inherit the warning. Patches `directives/starter-kit-sync.md` Step 10 to show the correct command sequence (separate Bash calls, no pipe-trim chains, explicit env var on commit and push).
<!-- /hero -->

### Added
- **universal-claude-md-template.md** — new "Bash pipelines return the LAST command's exit code" bullet under `## Shell & Platform`. Warns against `cmd | tail -N && destructive_cmd` patterns, recommends separate Bash tool calls or `set -o pipefail` prefix.

### Changed
- **directives/starter-kit-sync.md** Step 10 — commit now includes `SKIP_MAIN_PROTECTION=1 SKIP_STEP_MARK_CHECK=1` and push includes `SKIP_MAIN_PROTECTION=1`. Kit sync commits hit two enforcement hooks by default: the main-branch-protection hook (refuses direct-to-main) and the step-mark hook (requires `tasks/todo.md` staged when the commit message contains a version tag). Neither applies to kit sync commits. The `.tmp/.sync-doe-active` bypass only covers the kit write guard. Added explicit guidance to run each git command as a separate Bash tool call rather than `&&` chain with pipe-trimmed output, to prevent the stray-tag-on-wrong-commit failure that occurred during the v1.55.10 sync.

## v1.55.10 (2026-04-21)
<!-- hero -->
Enables the Adversarial subagent to run with `isolation: worktree` by fixing a silent worktree-safety bug in the review-gate handshake: `persist_review_findings.py` previously wrote its artifact to `Path(".tmp")/...`, which under worktree isolation landed in the worktree's `.tmp/` — invisible to the downstream gate, silently blocking PR creation. Adds four new universal learnings as directive subsections/sections (plan freshness check, contract `Verify:` reality check, subagent implementation patterns). Makes pytest runs venv-aware so they do not break on Homebrew Python's PEP 668 externally-managed guard.
<!-- /hero -->

### Added
- **directives/planning-rules.md** — "Plan freshness check" subsection. Plans written 10+ days before building accumulate staleness (version numbers taken, file references renamed, CLAUDE.md restructured). Before Step 0 of an old-plan feature, verify backticked paths, version ranges, and structural assumptions (routing, filenames, hook names).
- **directives/testing-strategy.md** — "Contract `Verify:` strings are design-phase guesses" subsection. `Verify:` patterns in plans reference class/id/function names that don't exist yet; by Step N the actual code may use different names. Re-verify against the real implementation before marking `[x]`, and fix the contract (not the code). Applies doubly to manual test instructions.
- **directives/subagent-protocol.md** — new "Implementation Patterns" section with four entries: (1) passing context to subagents (pass data sources, not descriptions), (2) parallel subagents on overlapping files (merge into one commit unless worktree-isolated), (3) monitoring and coordination via PostToolUse hooks, (4) worktree root resolution (`Path.cwd()` breaks in worktrees; use `.git` file detection).

### Changed
- **.claude/agents/Adversarial.md** — added `isolation: worktree` to frontmatter. Adversarial now runs in its own auto-created git worktree: if it makes no changes the worktree auto-cleans, otherwise the path and branch are returned for review. Unblocks speculative-fix diffs on top of its existing findings cross-examination work.

### Fixed
- **global-scripts/persist_review_findings.py** — uses `doe_utils.resolve_project_root()` to write the review artifact to the main repo's `.tmp/` regardless of cwd. Previously used `Path(".tmp")/...` which landed in the worktree's `.tmp/` under `isolation: worktree`, silently breaking the review-gate handshake and blocking PR creation with no clear cause. `ImportError` fallback preserves single-Path behaviour for machines without `doe_utils.py` installed.
- **execution/test_methodology.py** — `scenario_execution_script_tests` prefers `.venv/bin/python3` if present, falls back to `sys.executable` otherwise. Unblocks pytest runs on fresh macOS/Homebrew boxes where PEP 668 blocks system-Python pip installs. `sys.executable` fallback preserves CI and non-venv behaviour.

## v1.55.9 (2026-04-20)
<!-- hero -->
Reconciles a pre-existing inconsistency between `directives/data-safety.md` (which recommended `.env.local` for local dev in regulated-data projects) and `.claude/hooks/block_secrets_in_code.py` (which blocks `.env.local` entirely). The kit standardises on `.env` as the single canonical secrets file across all frameworks — including Next.js, deviating from its default `.env.local` convention — and the directive now reflects that rule with a new explanatory note at the top of the Environment Isolation section.
<!-- /hero -->

### Changed
- **directives/data-safety.md** — added a "Convention: `.env` is the single secrets file" subsection at the top of section 1 (Environment Isolation) explaining the kit's uniform `.env` rule and noting the deviation from Next.js's `.env.local` default.
- **directives/data-safety.md** — updated the Local dev row in the environment isolation table and two Non-Negotiable Requirements bullets to reference `.env` instead of `.env.local`, consistent with `block_secrets_in_code.py`'s whitelist.

## v1.55.8 (2026-04-20)
<!-- hero -->
Fixes the Claude PR Review GitHub Actions workflow, which had been failing silently on every trigger. Adds the missing `id-token: write` permission needed for OIDC token fetch, removes an invalid `allowed_tools` input that the v1 action rejects, and narrows the trigger so the workflow only fires when `@claude` is explicitly mentioned (instead of running on every collaborator comment).
<!-- /hero -->

### Fixed
- **.github/workflows/claude.yml** — added `id-token: write` to the job's `permissions:` block (required by `claude-code-action@v1` for OIDC; absence caused every run to fail with "Could not fetch an OIDC token").
- **.github/workflows/claude.yml** — removed `allowed_tools: "Bash,Read,Glob,Grep,Edit,Write"` input; `allowed_tools` is not a valid input for `claude-code-action@v1` (spec lists `trigger_phrase`, `assignee_trigger`, `label_trigger`, `base_branch`, etc.).

### Changed
- **.github/workflows/claude.yml** — tightened trigger filter so the workflow only runs when the comment contains `@claude` in addition to the existing collaborator-author check. Prevents CI burn on every routine comment from a collaborator.

## v1.55.7 (2026-04-20)
<!-- hero -->
Fixes the hardcoded upstream repo slug in `/request-doe-feature` and `/report-doe-bug`. Scripts previously pointed at a non-existent `williamporter/doe-starter-kit`, causing every filing attempt to fall back to local-only saves. Both commands now correctly hit `Albion-Labs/doe-starter-kit` and file issues directly.
<!-- /hero -->

### Fixed
- **execution/doe_feature_request.py** — `UPSTREAM_REPO` constant and help docstring both updated from `williamporter/doe-starter-kit` to `Albion-Labs/doe-starter-kit`.
- **execution/doe_bug_report.py** — `UPSTREAM_REPO` constant updated.
- **global-commands/report-doe-bug.md** — manual-file fallback URL updated.

## v1.55.6 (2026-04-09)
<!-- hero -->
Tutorial version now pulls from a single source of truth (`kit-version.js`). All 20 pages load one JS file instead of relying on 20 separate HTML stamps. Stamp script updated to write kit-version.js first, HTML fallback second. Version can never go out of sync across pages again.
<!-- /hero -->

### Added
- **docs/tutorial/kit-version.js** — single source of truth for version displayed across all tutorial pages. Updates sidebar, hero badge, and footer via DOM injection.
- **`<script src="kit-version.js">`** injected into all 20 tutorial HTML pages before `</body>`.

### Changed
- **stamp_tutorial_version.py** — now updates kit-version.js as primary source, HTML patterns as no-JS fallback. Creates kit-version.js if missing.

## v1.55.5 (2026-04-09)
<!-- hero -->
CLAUDE.md quality scoring rewritten to be framework-agnostic. The rubric now scores DOE methodology compliance (architecture, triggers, commands, gotchas) instead of matching hardcoded tool names. Any tech stack scores fairly. Kit template CLAUDE.md updated with universal Common Commands and Gotchas sections.
<!-- /hero -->

### Changed
- **test_methodology.py: claude_md_quality** — complete rewrite. Two-tier rubric: DOE Methodology (60 pts) checks structural compliance (architecture, directory structure, trigger routing, commands section, operational knowledge). Content Quality (40 pts) checks executable commands, conciseness, currency, and actionability. No hardcoded tool names — Go, Rust, Python, JS projects all score fairly.
- **CLAUDE.md template** — added `## Common Commands` section with universal DOE commands (test_methodology, health_check, verify, git hooks, gh pr). Added `## Gotchas` section with 4 universal DOE gotchas (env files, context compaction, hook permissions, execution script determinism).

### Fixed
- **claude_md_quality: false positive** — directory-listing lines in code blocks (e.g. `directives/    # SOPs`) were counted as executable commands. Now skips lines where the first token ends with `/`.

## v1.55.4 (2026-04-08)
<!-- hero -->
Closes the hook installation gap that left migrating projects without critical safety hooks. setup.sh now installs all 9 project hooks, 4 agent definitions, and plan files when run inside a DOE project. The settings.json merge handles both PreToolUse and PostToolUse entries additively — existing project-specific hooks are preserved. Users running /pull-doe will now get the complete hook set automatically.
<!-- /hero -->

### Fixed
- **setup.sh: project hooks** — now copies all 9 `.claude/hooks/*.py` files to the project when run inside a DOE project (was only installing 2 global hooks). Includes block_dangerous_commands, block_secrets_in_code, protect_directives, guard_kit_writes, enforce_review_gate, confirm_pr_merge, check_plan_freshness, copy_plan_to_project, check_completed_feature.
- **setup.sh: settings.json merge** — now merges ALL hook registrations (PreToolUse + PostToolUse) from kit template into project settings.json additively. Previously only merged 2 PostToolUse entries globally. Preserves project-specific hooks.
- **setup.sh: agent definitions** — now copies `.claude/agents/` (Finder, Adversarial, Referee, ReadOnly) to projects that don't have them.
- **setup.sh: plan files** — now copies `.claude/plans/` files (multi-agent-coordination.md) to projects that don't have them.

## v1.55.3 (2026-04-08)

### Fixed
- **CLAUDE.md: 3 unrouted directives** — added triggers for `chrome-verification.md` (APP features with visual output), `data-safety.md` (database/SQL/data protection), `incident-response.md` (security incidents)
- **CLAUDE.md: Rule 7 pointer** — "Shared-file awareness" now points to `directives/context-management.md`
- **test_methodology.py: DAG validation path** — now checks both `execution/dispatch_dag.py` and `~/.claude/scripts/dispatch_dag.py` (global install since v1.52)
- **test_methodology.py: cross-reference checker** — `.claude/` paths now checked against kit directory as fallback (fixes false WARN on `.claude/plans/multi-agent-coordination.md` for existing projects that haven't run init wizard)

## v1.55.2 (2026-04-08)

### Changed
- **CLAUDE.md migration section** — expanded from 3-bullet callout to 7-step hands-on walkthrough with "what goes where" mapping table, CFA verification, recovery guidance, and timing advice
- **All 20 sidebars synced** — Core Concepts links (Thin Router, Adversarial Review, Defence in Depth), What's New section title, and Migration Guide now identical across every page
- **Sidebar versions** stamped to v1.55.2 across all pages

### Fixed
- **vercel.json reverted** — build command failed (Python3 not available in Vercel static deploy). Serving committed HTML via dashboard config instead

## v1.55.1 (2026-04-08)

### Fixed
- **What's New generator** — version now read dynamically from `git describe --tags` instead of hardcoded. Sync-doe order swapped: generate before stamp so the stamper catches the generated file.

### Added
- **Completed-feature warning hook** (`check_completed_feature.py`) — PostToolUse hook fires after any edit to todo.md. Warns immediately when all steps in ## Current are [x] but feature not moved to Done/Awaiting Sign-off.

## v1.55.0 (2026-04-08)
<!-- hero -->
The most comprehensive documentation update since the tutorials launched. Eight new concept sections on the Key Concepts page cover everything from DAGs to adversarial review. A brand-new Migration Guide walks users through upgrading from any DOE version with per-era checklists and CLAUDE.md before/after examples. The What's New page — generated from CHANGELOG.md and auto-regenerated on every release — gives every DOE user a single place to see what changed.
<!-- /hero -->

### Added
- **Migration Guide** (`docs/tutorial/migration-guide.html`) — comprehensive upgrade page with Find Your Version, 10-era overview table, 4 migration paths (v1.47 LOW, v1.49 HIGH, v1.51 MEDIUM, v1.52 MEDIUM), CLAUDE.md before/after, fresh-start vs surgical-upgrade decision tree, post-migration verification checklist
- **What's New page** (`docs/tutorial/whats-new.html`) — Conductor-inspired changelog page generated from CHANGELOG.md. Version badges, hero prose sections for major releases, expand/collapse by month for older releases, APP/INFRA tag badges, dark mode
- **What's New generator** (`execution/generate_whats_new.py`) — deterministic Python script, stdlib only. Parses both CHANGELOG heading formats, extracts hero blocks, renders HTML matching tutorial styling. Wired into `/sync-doe` Step 10
- **8 Key Concepts sections** — Thin Router, Phase-Based Directives, Dependency Graphs (DAGs), Rationalisation Tables, Adversarial Review, Defence in Depth, Deterministic Hooks, Context Recovery
- **6 CHANGELOG hero blocks** — v1.42.0 (Quality Stack), v1.44.0 (PR Workflow), v1.48.0 (Agent Discipline), v1.49.0 (CFA), v1.51.4 (Security), v1.52.0 (Init Wizard)
- **Missing v1.44.0 CHANGELOG entry** — PR Workflow Migration tag existed but changelog entry was never written
- **CLAUDE.md trigger** — `Updating CHANGELOG.md -> regenerate whats-new.html`

### Changed
- **CUSTOMIZATION.md** — expanded "Upgrading from Older Kit Versions" from v1.49-only section to comprehensive per-era migration guides with checklists for v1.47, v1.49, v1.51, v1.52. Added version identification section and link to tutorial
- **commands.html** — DOE KIT version v1.36.0 updated to v1.54.2 in terminal mockup
- **new-project.html** — DONE version v1.51.7 updated to v1.54.2. Project types expanded from 5 to 12 (added desktop, browser ext, library, monorepo, hardware, other). Framework card shows "Show all" (40 frameworks) and "Other" escape hatch
- **tips-and-mistakes.html** — example project version v1.28.0 updated to v1.50.0
- **Sidebar** — "What's New" added as first link (before Getting Started), "Migration Guide" added to Reference section across all 20 tutorial pages
- **starter-kit-sync.md** — `generate_whats_new.py` added to Step 10 (after version stamp, before git add)
- **Footer versions** — stamped to v1.55.0 across all 20 pages

## v1.54.0 (2026-04-07)

### Added
- **FRAMEWORKS registry** -- unified source of truth for 40 frameworks (6 Tier 1 with full templates, 34 Tier 2 with `_generic` fallback). Replaces 4 separate data structures (DETECT_PATTERNS, FRAMEWORK_OPTIONS, FRAMEWORK_PROJECT_TYPE, get_init_command dict). Computed shims preserve backwards compatibility.
- **11 project types** (was 5) -- desktop, browser extension, library/package, monorepo, hardware/IoT, plus "Other" with free-text on every selection.
- **"Other" escape hatch** -- every type and framework list ends with "Other (I'll describe it)" with free-text prompt. Custom text embedded verbatim in CLAUDE.md.
- **templates/_generic/** -- fallback template directory for Tier 2 frameworks. Contains scaffold.json, .gitignore, .env.example.
- **Platform targets** -- new `card_platform_targets()` question for desktop/mobile projects. Multi-select (macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, Web). Injected into CLAUDE.md.
- **execution/check_pending_prs.py** -- pre-commit hook validates ## Pending PRs in todo.md against `gh pr list`. Blocks stale entries (merged PRs), warns about missing entries (open PRs). Skips gracefully offline.
- **global-scripts/html_builder.py** -- shared HTML generation library (25+ components). Colour tokens, card components, status badges, progress bars, metric grids, data tables. Single source for DOE visual language.

### Changed
- **doe_init wizard flow** -- framework selection decoupled from project type ("Show all" option reveals full categorised list). Detection override opens full list without re-asking project type. Types with no dedicated frameworks skip straight to free-text.
- **Card functions return tuples** -- `card_project_type()` and `card_framework()` return `(key, custom_text)` instead of string. `run_wizard()` unpacks both.
- **write_doe_version()** -- switched from positional format to key=value format for forwards compatibility with future `doe update`.
- **get_active_layers()** -- browser_extension projects now get public_facing layer.
- **global-scripts/wrap_html.py** -- refactored to use html_builder (eliminated duplicated CSS).
- **global-scripts/eod_html.py** -- refactored to use html_builder (eliminated duplicated CSS).
- **manifest.json** -- added check_pending_prs.py to universal execution list.
- **.githooks/pre-commit** -- added Pending PRs sync validation section.
- **Test suite** -- 356 checks (was 142). 6 new tests: _other framework, _other project type, platform targets, new project types, registry regression guard, registry consistency.

## v1.53.1 (2026-04-07)

### Fixed
- **building-rules.md: monty-specific content** -- removed `execution/build.py` trigger (project-specific), replaced "PCON24 constituency codes" and "vote shares" examples with generic equivalents.
- **20_structure.md: phantom CHANGELOG.md** -- removed CHANGELOG.md from directory structure listing since `doe init` doesn't create it.
- **manifest.json: bad legal trigger** -- removed "Legal (email, donations, content)" trigger that pointed to documentation-governance.md (a document-versioning directive, not legal guidance).

## v1.53.0 (2026-04-07)

### Added
- **todo.md: contract Verify: patterns spec** -- formal specification of 4 executable verification patterns (`run:`, `file: exists`, `file: contains`, `html: has`), `[auto]` vs `[manual]` guidance, and validation rules. Previously the template just said "must have a Contract: block" with no detail on what valid patterns look like.
- **todo.md: retro as mandatory final step** -- quick/full escalation rules, wave deferral format, and when to escalate from quick to full retro.
- **todo.md: Pending PRs detailed format** -- entry format spec (heading, summary, contains, detail table, post-merge checklist), merge order pointer, conflict tracking. Previously just an empty section.
- **todo.md: collapsible details for complex features** -- `<details><summary>` for 3+ step features with plan file linking.
- **todo.md: general format improvements** -- "this file tracks immediate work only" preamble, progress tracking belongs here not in plans, format is changeable.
- **manifest.json: 2 new triggers** -- "External data / API integration" (universal, points to building-rules.md) and "Legal (email, donations, content)" (regulated layer, points to documentation-governance.md).
- **20_structure.md: added CHANGELOG.md** to directory structure listing.

## v1.52.11 (2026-04-07)

### Fixed
- **todo.md template: missing sections** — added `## Awaiting Sign-off` and `## Pending PRs` sections with format rule documentation. These existed in mature projects but were never in the kit template, so fresh inits lacked them.

## v1.52.10 (2026-04-07)

### Fixed
- **audit_claims.py: false router WARNs** — `check_router_coverage` didn't recognize directory triggers (`adversarial-review/`, `best-practices/`), causing 7 false WARNs on every fresh init. Added `dir_refs` matching from `test_methodology.py`.
- **audit_claims.py: false cross-ref WARNs** — `check_cross_reference_consistency` lacked home-directory (`~/.claude/`) and kit-directory fallback paths, causing 8 false WARNs. Also skips `_TEMPLATE.md` files now.
- **data-safety.md: monty-specific content** — replaced "Monty" with "the system" and removed 2 monty-specific `.claude/plans/` cross-references that don't exist in other projects.
- **manifest.json: chrome-verification framework gate** — removed `frameworks` restriction from chrome-verification trigger. The `public_facing` layer gate is sufficient; framework filter caused install/trigger mismatch.
- **10_methodology.md: missing rule pointers** — added `->` directive pointers to Core Behaviour rules 2, 3, and 5.

## v1.52.1 (2026-04-03)

### Fixed
- **Init wizard: dead hooks** — `.claude/settings.json` (hook configuration) was never created. All 7 guardrail hooks were installed as files but never wired up. Now generated with PreToolUse + PostToolUse hooks, stripping kit-contributor-only entries.
- **Init wizard: missing files** — `.claude/agents/` (4 agent definitions), `.claude/plans/` (multi-agent coordination), `.claude/stats.json`, `ROADMAP.md`, `tasks/archive.md` were never scaffolded despite being referenced by commands and directives.
- **Init wizard: incomplete manifest** — 23/31 commands, 7/16 execution scripts, 8/24 directives, 3/9 global scripts, pre-push hook, and `data-safety.md` were missing from `manifest.json`. New projects got a fraction of the kit's capabilities.
- **Init wizard: NameError crash** — `DETECT_PATTERNS` referenced after rename to `_FALLBACK_DETECT_PATTERNS`. Wizard could not reach the confirmation card.
- **Init wizard: regulated layer** — `data-governance.md` and `legal-framework.md` were promised in the confirmation card but the template files didn't exist. Now created as proper GDPR/compliance scaffolds.
- **Review gate broken** — `/review` never called `record_review_result.py`, so `enforce_review_gate.py` blocked PR creation with no way to pass. Review command now records the verdict.
- **setup.sh: STATE.md written to kit repo** — `STATE_FILE` pointed to `$SCRIPT_DIR/STATE.md` (the kit) instead of the project's `STATE.md`. Fixed.
- **setup.sh: git hooks activated on kit** — `git config core.hooksPath` ran against the kit repo, not the user's project. Fixed.
- **setup.sh: Linux incompatibility** — `sed -i ''` is macOS-only. Now uses cross-platform detection.
- **Git init message never shown** — inverted `has_git` condition after successful init.
- **Test suite crash** — `test_doe_init.py` imported deleted `DETECT_PATTERNS` symbol.
- **Command paths broken** — `/report-doe-bug` and `/request-doe-feature` referenced `execution/` paths that only exist in the kit, not user projects. Fixed to `~/doe-starter-kit/execution/`.

### Added
- **`best-practices/` directives** — 5 language-specific best practice files (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python, React, TDD) now installed to projects.
- **Quality Gate trigger** — `"Completed 4+ steps on current feature"` trigger added to manifest. Ensures mid-build verification on long features.
- **6 new triggers** — subagent-protocol, starter-kit-pull, tdd-and-debugging, multi-agent-coordination, incident-response, quality gate.
- **Framework detection from scaffold.json** — replaces hardcoded `DETECT_PATTERNS` dict. Single source of truth with fallback.
- **First-time `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`** — universal learnings template installed for users who don't have one.

### Changed
- **SYSTEM-MAP.md** — updated to reflect actual installed files (was documenting 3 hooks when 7 are installed, missing agents/plans/stats.json from project tree).
- **README.md** — corrected file counts (49→120+, 29→31 commands, 15→18 tutorials, 43→55 docs).
- **CUSTOMIZATION.md** — corrected command count (24→31).
- **Commands README** — added `/doe-health` and `/code-trace` documentation.

## v1.52.0 (2026-04-02)
<!-- hero -->
DOE becomes a conversation, not a copy-paste. The init wizard replaces blind setup.sh with an 8-card interactive flow that detects your framework, asks what you're building, and scaffolds a project with exactly the files you need. Composable capability layers (universal, public-facing, data-handling, regulated) mean a static HTML site and a GDPR-regulated SaaS app both start from the same wizard — they just get different files.
<!-- /hero -->

### Added
- **DOE Init Wizard** (`execution/doe_init.py`) — conversational scaffolding tool replacing blind setup.sh copy. 8-card bordered UX, framework auto-detection, composable CLAUDE.md generation, additive capability layers (universal, public-facing, data-handling, regulated). Supports Next.js, Vite, Python, Go, Flutter, static HTML.
- **Framework templates** (`templates/`) — per-framework scaffold.json, claude_section.md, .gitignore, .env.example for 6 frameworks. Base templates for CLAUDE.md sections and capability layers.
- **Manifest** (`manifest.json`) — single source of truth mapping layers to kit files and trigger lists. Data-driven file installation.
- **Integration tests** (`execution/test_doe_init.py`) — 142 checks across 6 frameworks, new-project and existing-project paths.
- **Tutorial: Starting a New Project** (`docs/tutorial/new-project.html`) — full walkthrough for new and existing projects with terminal card mockups.
- **IDE Compatibility** (`docs/tutorial/ide-setup.html`) — setup guidance for Cursor and other IDEs.

### Changed
- **Global script reorg** — 6 shared tooling scripts moved from `execution/` to `global-scripts/` (wrap_html.py, eod_html.py, dispatch_dag.py, run_snagging.py, record_review_result.py, persist_review_findings.py). Installed to `~/.claude/scripts/` by setup.sh.
- **setup.sh** — delegates to init wizard for new projects. Copies global-scripts/ to ~/.claude/scripts/.
- **Global commands** (wrap.md, eod.md, crack-on.md) — updated paths from `execution/` to `~/.claude/scripts/`.
- **Agent definitions** (Finder, Adversarial, Referee) — updated persist_review_findings.py path.
- **Sidebar navigation** — all 17 tutorial pages updated with new entries.

## v1.51.7 (2026-04-02)

### Added
- **PR merge confirmation hook** (`confirm_pr_merge.py`) — blocks `gh pr merge` and forces a two-step confirmation flow. Claude shows a bordered card with PR details and asks before merging. No bypass without user approval.

### Changed
- **Dangerous commands** (`block_dangerous_commands.py`) — `gh pr merge` moved from absolute block to dedicated confirmation hook. Claude can now merge with user approval instead of never.
- **Settings** (`settings.json`) — registered `confirm_pr_merge.py` as PreToolUse bash hook.

## v1.51.6 (2026-04-02)

### Fixed
- **Contract check false positive** (`check_contract.py`) — only blocks on unchecked `[auto]` criteria, no longer treats `[manual]` items as blocking. Eliminates need for `SKIP_CONTRACT_CHECK=1` on every commit after a step with pending manual items.
- **Review gate scope** (`enforce_review_gate.py`) — gates (steps-complete + adversarial review) now only apply to `feature/*` branches. Housekeeping, wrap, and other non-feature branches pass through freely.

### Added
- **Step-marking enforcement** (`commit-msg` hook) — blocks commits with "Step N" or version tag `(vX.Y.Z)` in the message unless `tasks/todo.md` is staged. Skip: `SKIP_STEP_MARK_CHECK=1`.
- **Main-branch protection** (`pre-commit` hook) — blocks direct commits to main/master locally (allows merge commits). Skip: `SKIP_MAIN_PROTECTION=1`.
- **Steps-complete PR gate** (`enforce_review_gate.py`) — blocks `gh pr create` on feature branches if not all steps in ## Current are complete. Prevents mid-feature PRs.

### Changed
- **Building rules** (`building-rules.md`) — documents step-marking enforcement hook.

## v1.51.5 (2026-04-02)

### Changed
- **No mid-feature PRs rule** (`building-rules.md`) — push to feature branch to save work between sessions, PRs created at retro only. Reduces PR overhead for multi-session features.
- **Wrap mid-feature branch handling** (`wrap.md`) — Step 0 rewritten: mid-feature sessions stay on the feature branch, wrap data commits directly to it. No separate housekeeping branch or PR. Step 1 no longer suggests creating PRs mid-feature.

## v1.51.4 (2026-04-01)
<!-- hero -->
Professional security defaults for every DOE project. Review gates block PR creation without adversarial review proof-of-work. Step-marking enforcement ensures todo.md tracks progress mechanically. Slack notifications, integrations directive, and sync audit self-tests round out the release. The principle: deterministic enforcement beats probabilistic rules.
<!-- /hero -->

### Added
- **Review gate hook** (`enforce_review_gate.py`) — blocks PR creation without Finder subagent proof-of-work
- **Review findings persistence** (`persist_review_findings.py`, `record_review_result.py`) — proof-of-work artifacts for adversarial review gate
- **Slack wrap notification** (`slack_notify.py`) — posts session wrap summaries to Slack via incoming webhook with Block Kit formatting
- **Integrations directive** (`directives/integrations.md`) — setup guide for GitHub + Slack notifications (recommended, not required)
- **Sync audit self-test** in `audit_sync.py` — validates classification logic with `--self-test` flag
- **Step 0 pre-flight** in sync directive — documents `audit_sync.py` workflow and file classification rules

### Changed
- **Agent definitions** (Finder, Adversarial, Referee) — persist findings section for review gate integration
- **Delivery rules** — `/review` step before PR creation, hook enforces review artifact exists
- **Dangerous commands hook** — blocks `SKIP_REVIEW_GATE`, `SKIP_CONTRACT_CHECK`, `SKIP_SIGNOFF_CHECK` bypass flags
- **Documentation governance** — clearer staleness rule (1 minor version threshold)

## v1.50.1 (2026-04-01)

### Added
- **Sync gap check** in `/wrap` command — runs `audit_sync.py --json` and warns if universal files are missing from kit

## v1.50.0 (2026-04-01)

### Added
- **Sync audit script** (`execution/audit_sync.py`) — pre-flight for /sync-doe that compares project vs kit across 7 directories, flags universal files missing from kit
- **Feature request handler** (`execution/doe_feature_request.py`) — scans kit for overlap, searches GitHub issues, files sanitised bug reports
- **Snagging orchestrator** (`execution/run_snagging.py`) — pre-merge verification gate, reads contracts from todo.md
- **Documentation scanner** (`execution/scan_docs.py`) — audits tutorial/reference docs against kit version
- **DOE health command** (`global-commands/doe-health.md`) — `/doe-health` wrapper for methodology tests
- **Unit tests** for 4 shared execution scripts (`tests/execution/test_audit_claims.py`, `test_health_check.py`, `test_verify.py`, `test_wrap_stats.py`)
- **Quality Gate section** in `building-rules.md` — mid-feature checkpoints every 4 steps with blast radius assessment
- **Pre-Retro Quality Gate** in `delivery-rules.md` — mandatory methodology + Finder pass before retro
- **Invariant promotion step** in retro procedure (step 7) — auto-promote lasting contracts to `tests/invariants.txt`
- **Playwright MCP section** in `testing-strategy.md` — guidance on converting `[manual]` criteria to `[auto]` with browser automation
- **Cross-file consistency check** (item 6) in `Finder.md` agent definition

### Changed
- **eod_html.py** — DOE Kit sync indicator now shows user/creator change counts (e.g. "not synced (3u 2c)")

## v1.49.1 (2026-04-01)

### Added
- **todo.md structural linter** (`execution/lint_todo.py`) — enforces contract existence on every step, retro as last step, [APP] features require [manual] criteria
- **Quality gate runner** (`execution/quality_gate.py`) — wrapper for mid-feature checkpoints (`--checkpoint`) and pre-retro gates (`--pre-retro`), writes markers to `.tmp/`
- **Invariant bootstrap** (`execution/bootstrap_invariants.py`) — scans completed contracts and promotes lasting patterns to `tests/invariants.txt`
- **Invariants template** (`tests/invariants.txt`) — empty file with format docs, ready for project-specific invariants
- **5 new pre-commit checks** in `.githooks/pre-commit`:
  - Sign-off enforcement — blocks `[ ] [manual]` in `## Done` (`SKIP_SIGNOFF_CHECK=1`)
  - Structural lint — calls `lint_todo.py` when `todo.md` is staged (`SKIP_TODO_LINT=1`)
  - Quality gate checkpoint — blocks after 4+ steps without running gate (`SKIP_QUALITY_GATE=1`)
  - Pre-retro gate — blocks retro commit without methodology pass (`SKIP_RETRO_GATE=1`)

## v1.49.0 (2026-04-01)
<!-- hero -->
The biggest structural change in DOE history. CLAUDE.md was rewritten from a 113-line inline rulebook into a 55-line thin router that loads directives on demand. Every token of irrelevant context degrades agent performance — this release operationalises that principle. Six phase-based directives now handle planning, building, delivery, context management, self-annealing, and framework evolution. A DAG executor enables parallel step dispatch, and custom adversarial review agents (Finder, Adversarial, Referee) provide structured multi-agent code review.
<!-- /hero -->

### Added
- **Phase-based directives** — 6 new directives extracted from CLAUDE.md: `planning-rules.md`, `building-rules.md`, `delivery-rules.md`, `context-management.md`, `self-annealing.md`, `framework-evolution.md`
- **Adversarial review guide** (`directives/adversarial-review/README.md`) — blast radius matrix, Finder/Adversarial/Referee agent roles with scoring, invocation modes, DAG integration
- **DAG executor** (`execution/dispatch_dag.py`) — dependency graph from `Depends:`/`Owns:` metadata in todo.md. Modes: `--validate`, `--graph`, `--dispatch`, `--status`
- **Custom agent definitions** (`.claude/agents/`) — Finder, Adversarial, Referee, ReadOnly agents for adversarial review with mechanically blocked Edit/Write
- **8 new methodology scenarios** (10-17) in `audit_claims.py` and `test_methodology.py` — router coverage, rule completeness, scale consistency, DAG validation, directive schema, cross-reference consistency, agent definition integrity, plan vs actual
- **Three-Level Verification** section in `directives/testing-strategy.md` — Exists/Substantive/Wired depth levels for contract criteria
- **Pre-push methodology checks** (`.githooks/pre-push`) — runs `test_methodology.py --quick` before every push
- **Methodology Tests CI step** in `doe-ci.yml` — runs methodology checks in the DOE Gate tier
- **Upgrade guide** in `CUSTOMIZATION.md` — documents v1.49.0 CFA changes for existing users
- **Safe/Change with Care/Do Not Change** sections in `CUSTOMIZATION.md` — clear trichotomy for customisation risk

### Changed
- **CLAUDE.md** — rewritten from ~113-line monolith to ~55-line thin router. Rules replaced with one-liner pointers to phase directives. Trigger table replaces Progressive Disclosure section
- **SYSTEM-MAP.md** — updated to document CFA architecture (phase directives, agents, DAG executor, pre-push hook)
- **crack-on.md** — dependency analysis from DAG executor, session blocking for large features
- **test_methodology.py** — `--scenario` flag now accepts multiple values (`action="append"`)

## v1.48.0 (2026-03-31)
<!-- hero -->
Superpowers-inspired discipline enforcement for AI agents. Rationalisation tables map every common excuse for skipping guardrails to reality across 6 domains. Serial dispatch protocol (SDD) provides a structured workflow for sequential step execution. Adversarial review with confidence-scored findings, universal CI pipeline with three tiers, and 9 updated session commands complete the Agent Discipline era.
<!-- /hero -->

### Added
- **Agent Discipline directives** — rationalisation tables (6 domains, excuse-reality format), serial dispatch protocol (SDD workflow with decision tree), subagent status protocol (DONE/DONE_WITH_CONCERNS/NEEDS_CONTEXT/BLOCKED)
- **Adversarial review templates** (`directives/adversarial-review/`) — spec-reviewer, code-quality-reviewer, and implementer-prompt templates for two-pass confidence-scored code review
- **Data compliance directive** (`directives/data-compliance.md`) — UK GDPR, DPA 2018, PPERA guidance for personal data handling
- **Data safety directive** (`directives/data-safety.md`) — data protection, backup, and integrity rules
- **Kit write guard hook** (`.claude/hooks/guard_kit_writes.py`) — blocks direct writes to ~/doe-starter-kit, enforces /sync-doe workflow. File-based flag for bypass during sync, SKIP_KIT_GUARD=1 for kit-native work
- **DOE health checks** (`execution/test_methodology.py`) — 9 methodology scenarios including CLAUDE.md quality scoring with letter grades
- **/request-doe-feature** command — structured feature request filing for the DOE starter kit
- **Universal CI pipeline** (`.github/workflows/doe-ci.yml`) — three-tier auto-detecting CI (gates/advisory/AI review) with path filters and CI Result aggregator
- **Auto-rebase Action** (`.github/workflows/auto-rebase.yml`) — keeps open PR branches current with main

### Changed
- **9 commands updated** — crack-on, stand-up, sitrep, wrap, review, snagging, eod, hq, sync-doe. All now include PR conflict detection, branch staleness warnings, and open PR awareness
- **/review** — now supports arguments (--spec, --code, --tests, commit hash), confidence scoring (80+ threshold), bordered output with SPEC+CODE passes and verdict
- **/eod** — date argument support, Gist source fallback for past dates
- **/hq** — auto source (Gist + local fallback)
- **/sync-doe** — kit write guard flag integration
- **block_dangerous_commands.py** — added Supabase guards (DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY, db reset, deleteMany, emptyBucket)
- **PR template** — CI Result replaces hardcoded ESLint/Playwright/Lighthouse checks
- **setup.sh** — enhanced for CI pipeline and org rename
- **GitHub org** — references updated from iPolyphian to Albion-Labs
- **Tutorial pages** — version badge in sidebar, PR workflow updates

## v1.47.0 (2026-03-22)

### Added
- **TDD & debugging directive** (`directives/best-practices/tdd-and-debugging.md`) — Red-Green-Refactor enforcement with 7-excuse rationalisation table, 4-phase systematic debugging protocol (Investigate, Pattern Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Implementation). Includes "when to test" decision table by code type
- **Chrome verification directive** (`directives/chrome-verification.md`) — protocol for using Claude Code's Chrome MCP integration to auto-verify `[manual]` contract items. DOM checks, console checks, layout screenshots, with graceful degradation
- **4 CLAUDE.md triggers** — TDD enforcement on new code, systematic debugging on failures, Chrome verification in snagging, Chrome prompt in crack-on for [APP] features

### Changed
- **crack-on** — Chrome enablement prompt for [APP] features. Does not auto-enable (context cost); just asks
- **snagging** — new Chrome verification Step 5 between test generation and report. Auto-verifies DOM, console, and layout items; leaves subjective items as `[manual]`

### Fixed
- **wrap_html.py** — auto-calculate timeline durations from timestamps instead of hand-estimates. Handles midnight crossing. Falls back to session total when timestamps missing

## v1.46.0 (2026-03-21)

### Changed
- **DOE Kit sync check simplified** — stand-up, crack-on, and wrap now use version-only comparison (kit tag vs STATE.md). No more file diffs or u/c classification. Eliminates false positives from project-specific customisations
- **/sync-doe reverted to direct push** — commits directly to kit main instead of creating a sync branch + PR. The sync procedure itself is the quality gate
- **/wrap session-specific sync reminder** — at session end, checks if kit-syncable files were modified THIS session and shows a targeted reminder. Replaces the persistent outbound push detection
- **/pull-doe self-correcting** — always updates STATE.md version after sync, even on "already up to date". Prevents stale version mismatches

### Added
- **Code verification rule in manual-testing directive** — verify function names, parameter types, and valid inputs against actual code before presenting test steps. Prevents design-phase language from contracts reaching users as broken test instructions
- **Info banner in test checklist HTML** — reminds testers to verify exact function signatures against the code before testing

## v1.45.0 (2026-03-21)

### Added
- **Pre-commit innerHTML/XSS check** — warns (blocking with `SKIP_XSS_CHECK=1` bypass) when innerHTML is used without escaping in staged JS files
- **Pre-commit STATE.md staleness check** — warns when code changes are committed without updating STATE.md
- **Wrap Step 0: branch cleanup** — checks if on a feature branch with a merged PR before wrapping, offers to switch back to main
- **5 compliance triggers in CLAUDE.md** — auto-load legal/compliance docs when building: personal data features (GDPR), email/SMS (PECR), donations (PPERA), content generation (imprints), opposition research (defamation)

### Changed
- **Rule 6** rewritten for branch+PR workflow — feature branches, commit per step on branch, `gh pr create` at retro, CI must pass before merge, no direct commits to main
- **Rule 11** updated — retro step now includes PR creation with template auto-filled from contract criteria

## v1.44.0 (2026-03-19)
<!-- hero -->
DOE moves from direct-to-main commits to a proper branch-based PR workflow. Feature branches, CI gating with GitHub Actions, branch protection on main, snagging as pre-merge gate with Chrome visual verification, and a complete multi-agent coordination protocol. The master-to-main branch rename, PR template, and session command updates ship together. Released as DOE kit v1.44.0.
<!-- /hero -->

### Added
- **Branch-based PR workflow** — feature branches, commit per step on branch, `gh pr create` at retro, CI must pass before merge, no direct commits to main
- **GitHub Action for AI PR review** — automated adversarial review on pull requests
- **Snagging as pre-merge gate** — Chrome visual verification integrated into snagging workflow
- **PR template** — auto-filled from contract criteria during retro
- **Multi-agent coordination protocol** — wave protocol rewrite for branch-based workflow
- **DOE tutorial page** (`docs/tutorial/pr-workflow.html`) — PR workflow documentation

### Changed
- **master to main branch rename** — all references updated across commands and documentation
- **Session commands** (stand-up, crack-on, sitrep, wrap) — updated for branch-based workflow with PR awareness

## v1.43.0 (2026-03-19)

### Documentation
- **Testing tutorial rewrite**: 3 inline SVG diagrams (filter funnel, runs-when timeline, tool map), updated catches/misses table, expanded baselines explanation
- **Maestro getting-started section**: Full mobile testing onboarding (install, flows, template, custom flow guide, config)
- **Troubleshooting expansion**: 4 new sections (Maestro 5 scenarios, bundle size 3 scenarios, CI/GitHub Actions 4 scenarios, tests-pass-but-broken teaching)
- **README accuracy fixes**: Command count (24→29), page count (10→15), file count updated

### Fixed
- Broken directive references in getting-started, key-concepts, example-apps tutorials
- Lighthouse now included in --bootstrap dependency install
- Lighthouse error message now points to --bootstrap instead of global install

---

## [v1.42.0] — 2026-03-18
<!-- hero -->
Quality Stack goes universal. Testing infrastructure now auto-detects and supports 16 project types — from Next.js to Flutter to Go. Maestro handles mobile UI testing with YAML flows. Framework-aware orchestration, multi-language health checks, and config-driven portability mean the same /snagging command works regardless of what you're building.
<!-- /hero -->

### Added
- **Multi-framework testing** — Quality Stack now supports 16 project types: static HTML, Next.js, Vite/React, Angular, Nuxt, Vue, SvelteKit, Remix, Astro, React Native, Expo, Flutter, Python, Go, PHP/Laravel, and Ruby/Rails. Auto-detects framework from project files and configures testing accordingly.
- **Maestro mobile testing** — React Native, Expo, and Flutter projects use Maestro for YAML-based UI testing. Bootstrap installs Maestro CLI automatically. Template flows in `.maestro/` (app-launch + navigation).
- **Framework-aware orchestrator** — `run_test_suite.py` reads `projectType` from `tests/config.json`, uses framework-specific build and serve commands. Adapters for all web frameworks, PHP built-in server, Rails, Go, and Python/Django.
- **Multi-language health check** — `health_check.py` scans 10+ languages with per-framework scan paths, stub patterns, TODO detection, and empty function detection. Supports `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.vue`, `.svelte`, `.astro`, `.py`, `.go`, `.php`, `.rb`, `.dart` files.
- **Path routing support** — `routeMode` field in `tests/config.json` — `"hash"` (default) or `"path"` (Next.js, Vite, SvelteKit, etc). helpers.js uses root path for path-based routing.
- **Distribution fix** — `setup.sh` copies Quality Stack execution scripts and test infrastructure to new projects. `/pull-doe` syncs Quality Stack files between kit and project.
- **Snagging auto-bootstrap** — `/snagging` automatically runs `--bootstrap` on first use instead of telling the user to do it manually.
- **Snagging copy dropdown** — Copy Results + Copy Bugs + Export section consolidated into a single dropdown menu with failure count badge.

### Changed
- **Generator multi-framework** — `generate_test_checklist.py` handles `maestro_results` with framework-specific tile labels, shows `projectType` badge in automated results header.
- **Health check per-language patterns** — TODO/FIXME detection uses `#` for Python/Ruby, `//` for JS/Go/Dart, `<!--` for Vue/Svelte/Astro templates. Empty function detection uses language-specific syntax (`def...pass` for Python, `func...{}` for Go, etc).

## [v1.41.3] — 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **Snagging dark mode** — section header and export section had `background: white` without dark mode overrides, causing white strips in dark mode. Both now get `background: #1e293b`.

## [v1.41.2] — 2026-03-18

### Changed
- **`/report-doe-bug` enhanced issue template** — added Component field (searchable by DOE command/script), Error Output section (sanitised traceback), What Was Tried section, User's Description section, Project Type in environment table.
- **Duplicate escalation** — structured duplicate comment format with version/severity/description. Adds +1 reaction to issues for sorting by most-affected. Auto-escalates priority labels: 2+ duplicate reports → `priority:high`, 5+ → `priority:critical`.
- **Simplified project type question** — "web app or mobile app?" instead of framework-specific options. Labels: `project:web` / `project:mobile`.
- **Draft card** — now shows Component, Error Output, and What Was Tried sections in the preview.

## [v1.41.1] — 2026-03-18

### Changed
- **`/report-doe-bug` UX improvements** — bordered output cards for all phases (environment, version check, user error, duplicates, draft preview, result). Questions asked one at a time instead of batched. Added project type question (Static HTML / Next.js / React Native / Flutter / Other) with `project:` label for backlog filtering.

## [v1.41.0] — 2026-03-18

### Added
- **`/report-doe-bug` command** — triage-first bug reporter for the DOE framework. 5-phase flow: gather user description + Claude reconstruction + environment capture, check if fixed in newer version (route to `/pull-doe`), detect user error (route to tutorial docs via dynamic HTML scanning), search for duplicates (offer to comment), then sanitise and file a structured GitHub Issue with labels (`bug`, `user-reported`, version tag, severity). Falls back to local markdown if `gh` CLI is unavailable.
- **`execution/doe_bug_report.py`** — deterministic execution script supporting the bug reporter. Subcommands: `--environment` (DOE version, OS, Node, Python, shell), `--version-check` (compare to upstream releases, parse CHANGELOG), `--check-gh` (verify GitHub CLI), `--scan-tutorials` (search tutorial HTML headings via stdlib HTMLParser), `--search-duplicates` (query existing issues), `--sanitise` (strip API keys, secrets, paths, emails), `--file-issue` (create GitHub Issue with labels), `--add-comment` (add context to duplicates). All output JSON.
- **Tutorial update** — added `/report-doe-bug` entry to `commands.html` Quality section.

## [v1.40.1] — 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Universal learning** — DOE Starter Kit section in `universal-claude-md-template.md`: never commit directly to `~/doe-starter-kit` during feature work, always use `/sync-doe` for the full release pipeline.

## [v1.40.0] — 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Quality Stack** — full testing infrastructure now ships with the starter kit. Includes `run_test_suite.py` (orchestrator with server lifecycle, parallel Playwright + Lighthouse), `health_check.py` (stub/TODO/empty function detection), `verify_tests.py` (Playwright wrapper), and `playwright.config.js`.
- **Template test specs** — generic `app.spec.js`, `accessibility.spec.js`, `visual.spec.js` that auto-discover pages from `tests/config.json`. Shared `helpers.js` for config-driven app path resolution.
- **Bootstrap command** — `python3 execution/run_test_suite.py --bootstrap` installs npm deps, Playwright browser, and creates initial baselines in one step.
- **Code trace in snagging** — `/snagging` now runs code trace automatically (no more yes/no prompt). Results appear in the automated summary section via new `--code-trace` flag on `generate_test_checklist.py`.
- **Enhanced verify.py** — `--regression` and `--deposit` flags for regression suite accumulation.
- **Config-driven portability** — `tests/config.json` extended with `appPrefix`, `routes`, `initScript` fields. All scripts read project-specific values from config instead of hardcoding.

### Changed
- `generate_test_checklist.py` renders automated results section when either test suite OR code trace data is available (previously required test suite only).

## [v1.39.5] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **SVG diagrams across 3 pages**: commands.html viewBox widened to 610 (fixes "weekly" text clipping). key-concepts.html and context.html SVGs changed from fixed `width`/`height` attributes to `width:100%;height:auto` so they scale responsively. Container padding reduced across all diagram containers.

## [v1.39.4] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **SVG lifecycle diagram**: cropped viewBox from `0 0 720 320` to `0 0 590 254` to match actual content bounds. Eliminates ~76px dead whitespace below legend and ~130px unused right margin.

## [v1.39.3] — 2026-03-17

### Changed
- **Command card layout** (commands.html): badge + origin tag now share a row (flex-wrap), summary text forced below via `flex-basis: 100%`. Reduced card padding from 20px 24px to 18px 20px.
- **"Built-in" renamed to "Default"** across all 6 command entries, section heading, and TOC link. CSS class `.cmd-origin.builtin` renamed to `.cmd-origin.default`.
- **Origin tag styling**: now uses `display: inline-flex; align-items: center; height: 22px` for consistent vertical alignment with the command badge.
- **SVG lifecycle diagram**: reduced container padding (28px 24px → 20px 16px 12px), reduced bottom margin (40px → 24px), SVG width changed from `max-width: 100%` to `width: 100%` to fill container.
- **Annotation list specificity**: `.annotation-list` → `.content .annotation-list` to override `.content ul { padding-left: 20px }` without relying on source order.

## [v1.39.2] — 2026-03-17

### Changed
- **Command card layout** across 3 tutorial pages (commands.html, testing.html, daily-flow.html): command badge now sits above the description text instead of beside it. Cleaner layout for long command names like `/code-trace --integration`.

## [v1.39.1] — 2026-03-17

### Changed
- **testing.html**: New "The Snagging Checklist" section explaining the automated results card (4 metric tiles, status badge, dark mode toggle), baseline updates, and the new /snagging flow. Updated /snagging command card, "What Runs When" table, "Your Role" section, and signposting description.
- **troubleshooting.html**: New "Snagging v2 Issues" section with 5 scenario cards (Lighthouse errors, port conflicts, APP_PATH mismatch, visual regression diffs, dark mode toggle). TOC link and Quick Reference table updated.
- **commands.html**: /snagging entry updated to describe automated test suite integration, results card, dark mode toggle, and baseline updates.

## [v1.39.0] — 2026-03-17

### Added
- **Snagging v2: Automated test results integration** — `/snagging` now runs `execution/run_test_suite.py` (if it exists) before generating the checklist. Results rendered as an automated results card with status badge (ALL PASS / WARNINGS / FAILURES), metric tile strip (Browser Tests, Visual Regression, Accessibility, Performance), expandable detail sections (health check, route coverage), and banner divider separating auto from manual checks.
- **Dark mode toggle** on snagging checklists — moon/sun button in the top bar, preference persisted in localStorage. Light mode is always the default.
- **Concept C step stripes** — section cards now have a thin header stripe showing step pill, completion timestamp, and "N of M" position indicator. Card title is just the clean feature name.
- **`--test-results` argument** for `generate_test_checklist.py` — accepts path to orchestrator JSON output. When omitted, generator produces the same output as before (manual checks only). Fully backwards-compatible.
- **Signpost banner divider** — "YOUR REVIEW — N checks below" separates automated results from manual check sections.
- **Baseline update instructions** in `/snagging` command — `--update-baselines`, `--update-visual`, `--update-lighthouse`, `--update-a11y`.

### Changed
- Snagging command restructured: new Step 2 (run test suite, portability-guarded), steps renumbered, paste-back handling documented.
- Checkbox indentation tightened — less left padding, narrower number column, smaller gaps.
- Disclosure arrows upgraded from tiny unicode triangles to proportional SVG chevrons with rotation animation.
- Heading parser now handles `[APP]`/`[INFRA]` tags without version ranges (e.g. `### Feature [INFRA]`).
- `extract_console_commands()` genericized — project-specific patterns replaced with commented examples.

## [v1.38.0] — 2026-03-17

### Added
- **New command: `/code-trace`** — AI-driven code tracing with three modes: single module (deep logic trace with BUG/WARN/INFO severity), integration (cross-module data flow), and full sweep. The probabilistic layer of the Quality Stack.
- **New tutorial page: Testing & Quality** (`docs/tutorial/testing.html`) — explains the three-layer defence (deterministic/probabilistic/empirical), what runs when, the user's role, and the signposting system.
- **New tutorial page: Troubleshooting** (`docs/tutorial/troubleshooting.html`) — every tool covered with "what you see / what it means / what to do" format. ESLint, Playwright, Lighthouse, health check, /code-trace, npm/Node, and git hook scenarios.
- **Quality sidebar section** added to all 15 tutorial pages linking to Testing & Quality and Troubleshooting.
- **ESLint + stub detection** in pre-commit hook — lints staged JS files (blocks on errors, bypassable with `SKIP_ESLINT=1`), warns on stubs (`return null`, `return []`, empty functions, "not implemented" markers). Path configurable via `JS_PATH` variable.
- **TEST HEALTH row** in `/stand-up` kick-off card — shows regression suite count and health check results at session start.
- **Health check step** in `/wrap` housekeeping — runs `health_check.py --quick` + regression suite at session end, records results in System Checks.
- `/code-trace` and `/health-check` added to commands.html Quality & Review section.
- npm/package.json setup note added to getting-started.html.
- Quality stack callout added to daily-flow.html work cycle.

## [v1.37.4] — 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- `execution/audit_claims.py`: retro steps (name starting with "Retro") now exempt from version tag check, same as `[INFRA]` steps. Prevents false WARN on `[APP]` feature retros which structurally don't get their own version bump.

## [v1.37.3] — 2026-03-16

### Added
- `.githooks/commit-msg`: changelog enforcement — versioned commits (containing `(vX.Y.Z)` tag) now require `CHANGELOG.md` to be staged. Prevents shipping versioned steps without a changelog entry. Skippable with `SKIP_CHANGELOG_CHECK=1`.

## [v1.37.1] — 2026-03-16

### Changed
- `execution/generate_test_checklist.py`: Option C header redesign — feature name as h1 with [APP] pill badge, env cards (Browser/Viewport/OS) top-right, 12px split progress bar (green pass + red fail), elapsed timer bottom-left with label, progress card with subtitle, Copy Bugs button (amber, conditional), Reset All with red styling, buttons right-aligned
- `execution/generate_test_checklist.py`: added `--verify` mode — re-checks known bugs via code trace and outputs unicode-bordered terminal summary instead of regenerating full HTML

## [v1.37.0] — 2026-03-16

### Changed
- `global-commands/stand-up.md`: DOE KIT line now shows u/c classification — `* pull (1u 2c)` where `u` = user-facing (commands, hooks, rules) and `c` = creator-facing (kit infra, tutorials, setup)
- `global-commands/crack-on.md`: same u/c classification for DOE KIT line
- `global-commands/wrap.md`: DOE Kit sync check classifies diffs as u/c, JSON schema includes `userCount`/`creatorCount` fields for HTML renderers

## [v1.36.1] — 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- `global-commands/snagging.md`: report box now uses Unicode box-drawing characters (`┌─┐`, `├─┤`, `└─┘`, `│`) instead of ASCII (`+`, `--`, `|`) for consistency with all other DOE command output
- `docs/tutorial/*.html`: fixed stale footer version stamps (v1.32.0 -> v1.36.0) across all 13 tutorial pages

### Added
- `execution/stamp_tutorial_version.py`: automation script to update tutorial footer/hero badge version strings; integrated into sync directive and `/sync-doe` command so footers are stamped before every release commit

### Changed
- `directives/starter-kit-sync.md`: Step 10 now runs `stamp_tutorial_version.py` before `git add -A`; post-sync checklist updated to reference auto-stamping
- `global-commands/sync-doe.md`: added step 11a to run `stamp_tutorial_version.py` before committing

## [v1.36.0] — 2026-03-16

### Added
- `global-commands/snagging.md`: `/snagging` command — auto-generates interactive HTML test checklists from todo.md `[manual]` contract items
- `directives/manual-testing.md`: SOP for the manual testing workflow (generation, testing, feedback loop, sign-off)
- `execution/generate_test_checklist.py`: HTML checklist generator with three-state toggles, timer, localStorage persistence, console code blocks with copy buttons, and export-to-clipboard
- `docs/tutorial/workflows.html`: "Manual Testing & Sign-off" section covering the /snagging workflow
- `docs/tutorial/commands.html`: `/snagging` command reference entry
- `CLAUDE.md`: Progressive Disclosure trigger for manual testing

### Changed
- `global-commands/wrap.md`: explicit `git push` at every commit point (housekeeping, stats, wrap data); `awaitingSignOff` now scans `## Current` for completed steps with unchecked `[manual]` items; added `checklistPath` field for linking to test checklists
- `global-commands/README.md`: added `/snagging` entry in Quality section

## [v1.35.0] — 2026-03-16

### Added
- CLAUDE.md rule 11: retro discipline with escalation triggers and quick/full format
- CLAUDE.md Self-Annealing: 100-session learnings curation protocol
- CLAUDE.md Progressive Disclosure: curation trigger (session multiple of 100)

## [v1.34.3] — 2026-03-16

### Added
- Dev server learning in `universal-claude-md-template.md`: new `## Dev Servers` section — kill stale instances before starting new ones to prevent on-demand compilation hangs (macOS + Windows commands)

## [v1.33.0] — 2026-03-16

### Added
- `docs/tutorial/multi-agent.html` — new Multi-Agent Workflows tutorial page covering waves, /agent-launch, /agent-status, worked example, merge process, and common pitfalls
- `docs/tutorial/faq.html` — new FAQ page with 12 Q&A pairs across 3 categories (Setup, Session, Framework problems) with cross-links to relevant pages

- Sidebar navigation updated across all 13 pages with multi-agent and FAQ links
- Pagination chain updated: workflows → multi-agent → example-apps, tips → faq → glossary
- Post-sync checklist added to starter-kit-sync directive for footer version tracking

## [v1.32.0] — 2026-03-15

### Added
- `docs/tutorial/context.html` — new Context Management tutorial page covering compaction, danger zone, /context command, /wrap, and recovery flows
- Tab infrastructure across all tutorial pages: content tabs (card-style toggling) and environment tabs (Terminal vs VSCode toggle)
- VSCode mockup component system with editor chrome, activity bar, and panel styling
- Hooks coverage and recovery flows section in tips-and-mistakes page
- Built-in vs DOE badge distinction on commands page

### Changed

- README: documentation section with tutorial and reference doc descriptions

## [v1.30.1] — 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- `CLAUDE.md` Rule 1 point (3): Awaiting Sign-off move now happens immediately when last step's `[auto]` criteria pass, not at session wrap — fixes circular dependency where manual checks couldn't be presented until a ceremony that required manual checks
- `todo.md` format rules step (6): Awaiting Sign-off is now the default destination for completed features; Done section description clarified to "all contracts verified"

## [v1.30.0] — 2026-03-12

### Added
- `## Awaiting Sign-off` section in todo.md format rules — intermediate state between code-complete and fully verified
- `check_manual_signoff` audit check in `audit_claims.py` — WARNs if unchecked `[manual]` contracts found in `## Done`
- SIGN-OFF row in `stand-up.md` (both kick-off and status modes) — surfaces pending manual verification counts
- SIGN-OFF row in `sitrep.md` — same pending count between COMMITS and ELAPSED
- `awaitingSignOff` field in `wrap.md` JSON schema — collapsible grouped cards for manual test items
- `render_awaiting_signoff()` in `wrap_html.py` — collapsible `<details>/<summary>` cards with themed groups, amber styling

### Changed
- `CLAUDE.md` Rule 1 `[manual]` criteria point (3): features now move to `## Awaiting Sign-off` at completion instead of `## Done`; `## Done` requires all `[manual]` criteria `[x]`
- todo.md format rules: added conditional retro routing — features with unchecked `[manual]` go to Awaiting Sign-off, not Done

## [v1.29.0] — 2026-03-12

### Added
- Platform/model/tag tracking in `wrap_stats.py` (`--platform`, `--model`, `--tag` CLI args, `auto_classify_tag()`)
- Badge helpers and CSS in `wrap_html.py` and `eod_html.py` (platform/model/tag pills)
- Dark/light toggle with auto mode (6am-6pm) and manual override via localStorage in all three renderers
- GitHub-style streak heatmap in `build_hq.py` (52-week SVG grid, responsive full-width)
- Side-by-side platform + model stats layout in `build_hq.py`

### Changed
- `build_hq.py`: search/filters moved below Features This Week swimlane
- `build_hq.py`: model stats shown even with single model (removed 2+ threshold)

### Fixed
- `eod_html.py`: breakdown bar CSS overflow (flex-shrink + max-width + overflow:hidden)
- `.githooks/commit-msg`: cross-platform temp file approach replaces macOS-only `sed -i ''`
- `.githooks/pre-commit`: added `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` for Windows cp1252 compatibility

## [v1.28.0] — 2026-03-12

### Changed
- `wrap.md`: save session JSON to `docs/wraps/` instead of copying the rendered HTML. HTML is generated on demand from JSON. Smaller commits, HQ regenerates as needed.

## [v1.27.3] — 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- `build_hq.py`: HQ "This Week" summary now shows one headline activity per project (max 3) instead of dumping multiple semicolon-separated summary fragments that got truncated.

## [v1.27.2] — 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- `build_hq.py`: HQ project cards now read version from git tags (most reliable) with fallback to session summary text. Previously only checked summaries, so projects with tags but no version in summaries showed no version.

## [v1.27.1] — 2026-03-11

### Added
- `wrap_stats.py`: automatic git version tagging at wrap time. Reads `**Current app version:**` from STATE.md and creates the git tag if it doesn't exist. Ensures HQ dashboard always shows the project version.

## [v1.27.0] — 2026-03-10

### Added
- `/hq` command: unified project dashboard with portfolio view and per-project drill-down (SPA hash routing). Replaces `/archive-global`.
- `build_hq.py` global script: generates the HQ dashboard HTML with light/dark theme, search, feature swimlanes, timeline scrubber.

### Changed
- `/wrap` registry snippet now preserves existing fields (e.g. `displayName`) when re-registering a project.
- Version detection across `/commands`, `/sync-doe`, `/pull-doe` now reads from `git describe --tags` in `~/doe-starter-kit` instead of the stale `~/.claude/.doe-kit-version` file.
- `setup.sh` no longer writes `~/.claude/.doe-kit-version` — the git tag is the single source of truth.

### Fixed
- `.githooks/commit-msg`: case-insensitive regex now catches `Co-Authored-By` (previously only matched `Co-authored-by`).

### Removed
- `/archive-global` command (superseded by `/hq`).
- `~/.claude/.doe-kit-version` file dependency (replaced by git tags).

## [v1.26.0] — 2026-03-10

### Added
- `/archive-global` command: global portfolio dashboard aggregating all registered projects. Shows time allocation, project health cards (Active/Idle/Dormant), cross-project timeline. Reads `~/.claude/project-registry.json`.
- Two universal triggers in CLAUDE.md Progressive Disclosure: multi-agent coordination and `/scope` feature scoping.

### Changed
- `/wrap` now auto-registers the project in `~/.claude/project-registry.json` after committing stats, enabling the global archive to discover projects automatically.

## [v1.25.0] — 2026-03-10

### Added
- `/scope` command: conversational feature scoping through 3 phases (Explore, Define, Bound). Produces structured brief in `.claude/plans/` and updates ROADMAP.md with SCOPED status tag.
- New "Product" section in README grouping `/scope` and `/pitch`.

### Changed
- `/stand-up` DOE Kit indicator: directional sync labels (`* push`, `* pull`, `* push+pull`) replace generic `*`. Users now know which direction needs syncing.
- `/stand-up` kick-off: 100-session milestone celebration card for lifetime session milestones.

## [v1.24.5] — 2026-03-09

### Added
- `wrap_html.py`: `--theme light|dark` CLI flag for light/dark mode toggle
- `wrap_html.py`: `body.light` CSS variables with warm off-white palette (`#f0efe9` bg, `#f8f7f3` surface) for daytime readability
- `wrap_html.py`: body class toggle wiring for theme selection

## [v1.24.4] — 2026-03-09

### Changed
- `/stand-up` SINCE LAST MILESTONE: groups related commits by feature/theme with summaries instead of listing individually (max 6 groups)
- `/wrap` section 3e: auto-detects light/dark theme based on time of day (6am-6pm = light, otherwise dark)

## [v1.24.3] — 2026-03-07

### Added
- `/stand-up` BLOCKERS row: reads STATE.md `## Blockers & Edge Cases` and surfaces them with `!!` prefix in both kick-off and status mode cards. Positioned between CONTRACT and DOE KIT. Omitted when no blockers exist.

## [v1.24.2] — 2026-03-06

### Changed
- `/sync-doe` and `/pull-doe` now update STATE.md's DOE kit version as a final step, preventing false "inbound update pending" signals in `/stand-up`

## [v1.24.1] — 2026-03-06

### Changed
- EOD report stats bar format: "Friday 6th March | HH:MM | X Day streak" (human-readable date with ordinal suffix, current time, streak count)

## [v1.24.0] — 2026-03-06

Wrap and EOD report layout improvements — session stats promoted to below title card, report type label divider added above title card.

### Added
- Report label divider above title card in both wrap and eod HTML reports ("Session Report" / "End of Day Report")
- Session stats bar below title card (session number, streak, lifetime commits) — moved from footer

### Changed
- `wrap_html.py`: title card no longer includes "Session N —" prefix (session number now in stats bar)
- `eod_html.py`: title card no longer includes date (date now in stats bar)
- Footer simplified to DOE attribution only in both reports
- `wrap_stats.py`: session stats template includes `summary` field

## [v1.23.0] — 2026-03-06

Stand-up gains pipeline sync detection. Sync directive upgraded to 3-layer diffing with README consistency checks.

### Added
- `/stand-up` kick-off: PIPELINE row comparing ROADMAP.md Up Next count vs todo.md Queue count — nudges user to scope and promote features
- `sync-doe` directive: 3-layer comparison (DOE kit, installed global, local project) catches edits at any layer
- `sync-doe` directive: README consistency verification step ensures every command has a README entry

### Changed
- `/stand-up`: reads ROADMAP.md in kick-off mode
- `/agent-status`: card header renamed from "AGENT STATUS" to "HQ"
- `global-commands/README.md`: `/stand-up` description updated to mention pipeline sync

## [v1.22.6] — 2026-03-06

Fix summary-to-breakdown spacing in wrap and eod HTML reports.

### Fixed
- `.summary-lead` CSS: replaced `margin-bottom` with `padding-bottom` to prevent margin collapsing between summary paragraph and first breakdown heading
- `.breakdown-group` CSS: added `margin-top: 0.6rem` for consistent spacing between groups

## [v1.22.5] — 2026-03-06

Updated command reference (global-commands/README.md) to reflect recent changes.

### Added
- `/agent-verify` entry -- contract verification command (solo + wave mode)
- `/test-suite` entry -- persistent test suite runner

### Changed
- `/wrap` description updated to reflect HTML output (wrap_html.py, commit groups, decision/learning pills, timeline percentages, vibe)
- `/eod` description updated to reflect HTML output (eod_html.py, daily timeline, commit breakdown bars, 9-metric grid)
- `/audit` note added about merged commands (/quick-audit, /vitals, /doe-health)
- `/agent-status` description updated with full mode list (--plan, --preview, --launch, --merge, --reclaim, --abort, --watch)
- `/commands` date updated

---

## [v1.21.1] — 2026-03-06

### /wrap overhaul
- Summary section: plain English with vibe merged in (no separate section)
- Timeline: legend for dot colours, % per entry, total session time
- Commits: grouped by feature with headers and counts
- Decisions: Problem/Solution format with coloured pill labels
- Learnings: Discovery/Change format with coloured pill labels
- Today's Sessions: new section showing all sessions with duration and summary
- Section reorder: Timeline → Metrics → Commits → Decisions → Checks → Sessions → Next Up
- Removed Journey section, narrative guidance tightened to 2-3 sentences
- Session summary stored in stats.json for cross-session recall

---

## [v1.21.0] — 2026-03-06

Slash command audit: 29 to 24 commands. Consolidated overlapping commands, removed low-value ones.

### Changed
- **`/hq` renamed to `/agent-status`** — clearer name for the multi-agent dashboard command. File renamed from `hq.md` to `agent-status.md`. All internal references updated.
- **`/audit` now comprehensive** — merged `/quick-audit`, `/vitals`, and `/doe-health` into a single `/audit` command covering claims, workspace health, and DOE framework integrity in one bordered output.
- Updated `/commands` reference card, README, SYSTEM-MAP, CUSTOMIZATION, and global-commands/README to reflect new command set.

### Removed
- **`/quick-audit`** — absorbed into `/audit`
- **`/vitals`** — absorbed into `/audit`
- **`/doe-health`** — absorbed into `/audit`
- **`/shower-thought`** — low usage, removed
- **`/eli5`** — low usage, removed

---

## [v1.20.4] — 2026-03-06

Manual verification approach: batch at feature end, not per-step.

### Changed
- **Solo verification discipline** (CLAUDE.md Rule 1) — `[auto]` criteria gate each step autonomously. `[manual]` criteria batched and presented at feature completion as a single test checklist. Mid-feature visual checkpoint for 5+ step features. Prefer converting `[manual]` to `[auto]` where possible.
- **todo.md format rules** — `[manual]` criteria description updated to match: batch at feature end, prefer auto conversion.

## [v1.20.3] — 2026-03-06

Visual docs must be saved to project `docs/` directory, not ephemeral global paths.

### Added
- **Code Hygiene rule** — visual docs (brainstorms, diagrams, guides) go to `docs/` in the project root, never to `~/.agent/diagrams/` or other global paths
- **Directory Structure** — `docs/` entry added for generated visual documents

## [v1.20.2] — 2026-03-06

Retro rule improvement: completed features now get full roadmap cleanup, not just a status tag update.

### Changed
- **Retro step 3** — expanded from "update status tags" to also move feature from Up Next to Complete and refresh Suggested Next if it references the completed feature. Prevents stale roadmap entries accumulating.

## [v1.20.1] — 2026-03-06

Post-wave housekeeping fixes: audit regex, wave cleanup, and governed doc staleness surfacing.

### Fixed
- **Audit version tag regex** — now accepts both `→` (unicode) and `->` (ASCII), fixing false WARNs on wave-generated todo.md steps
- **Audit name extraction** — split pattern updated to handle `->` arrow format in task names
- **Wave file cleanup** — `--merge` now deletes completed wave JSON and log files instead of leaving them on disk (caused stale `active_wave` audit warnings)

### Added
- **Post-merge governed doc staleness check** — after merge completes, scans front-matter `Applies to` versions and warns if any governed doc is >1 minor version behind current app version
- **Updated post-merge message** — now explicitly mentions governed doc updates in the housekeeping checklist

## [v1.20.0] — 2026-03-05

Wave-1 post-mortem: fixed all multi-agent coordination bugs discovered during first parallel wave run. Hardened path resolution, log safety, todo update reliability, and added new monitoring tools.

### Added
- **`global-scripts/doe_utils.py`** — shared utility for worktree detection (`resolve_project_root()`), used by multi_agent.py, heartbeat.py, context_monitor.py
- **`--watch` flag** — auto-refreshing dashboard every 30 seconds, exits when all tasks complete
- **Wave agent guardrail** in CLAUDE.md — agents must not edit shared files on master during active waves
- **Post-merge auto-rebuild** — runs `buildCommand` from `tests/config.json` after each merge step

### Changed
- **CLAUDE.md Rule 1** — clearer solo vs wave verification distinction (wave mode defers to `--complete` and `--merge`)
- **`_update_todo_after_merge`** — searches entire todo.md file (not just `## Current`) and runs incrementally after each merge instead of once at the end
- **Stale threshold** — bumped from 120s to 300s to avoid false positives during long builds

### Fixed
- **Worktree path resolution** — `Path.cwd()` broke in worktrees; all scripts now use `doe_utils.resolve_project_root()` to find main repo root
- **Log race condition** — log file initialization moved inside `atomic_modify` lock to prevent two processes from clobbering each other
- **`--complete` verification** — passes worktree path to verify.py so file checks resolve correctly
- **`_analyze_wave`** — no longer rejects `manual:` prefixed criteria as invalid auto patterns

---

## [v1.19.0] — 2026-03-05

Combined `/agent-launch` and `/agent-start` into a single dual-mode command.

### Changed
- **`/agent-launch`** — now auto-detects mode: Launch (no active wave) creates wave and auto-claims first task; Join (active wave) claims next unclaimed task. Replaces the two-command workflow with one command for all terminals.

### Removed
- **`/agent-start`** — absorbed into `/agent-launch` Join mode. No longer needed as a separate command.

---

## [v1.18.4] — 2026-03-05

Pre-commit hook now gates on contract verification before allowing commits.

### Added
- **`.githooks/pre-commit`** — contract verification gate calls `execution/check_contract.py` before commit; skip with `SKIP_CONTRACT_CHECK=1`

---

## [v1.18.2] — 2026-03-05

Contract auto-generation in `/agent-launch`.

### Changed
- **`/agent-launch`** — added Step 0: scans Queue and Current for missing contracts, auto-generates from plan files, presents for user approval before wave creation
- **`global-commands/README.md`** — updated `/agent-launch` description

---

## [v1.17.3] — 2026-03-05

Complete verification coverage — solo, wave, and ad-hoc work.

### Changed
- **CLAUDE.md Rule 1** — added solo verification discipline (contract pre-flight + post-completion gate) and ad-hoc work verification (state criteria in conversation, verify before committing)

---

## [v1.17.2] — 2026-03-05

Pre-commit contract verification hook — hard gate for solo mode.

### Added
- **`execution/check_contract.py`** — parses todo.md, finds current step's contract, blocks commit if any criteria unchecked
- **`global-hooks/pre-commit`** — contract verification section appended (gated by `SKIP_CONTRACT_CHECK=1` env var)

---

## [v1.17.1] — 2026-03-05

Solo verification discipline — contract enforcement for all modes, not just waves.

### Changed
- **`/crack-on`** — contract pre-flight (validates Verify: patterns before starting) + post-completion verification (runs all criteria before marking steps done)
- **`/stand-up`** — kick-off mode surfaces contract health for next step (informational CONTRACT line in card)
- **Commands README** — updated /stand-up and /crack-on descriptions, added contract enforcement section

---

## [v1.17.0] — 2026-03-05

Mandatory task contracts with executable verification patterns.

### Changed
- **todo.md format rules** — contracts now mandatory for every step with `[auto]`/`[manual]` tags and 4 executable `Verify:` patterns (`run:`, `file: exists`, `file: contains`, `html: has`)
- **CLAUDE.md Rule 1** — appended contract requirement (tasks without testable contracts cannot be started)
- **CLAUDE.md Self-Annealing** — added test failure logging guidance (auto-test fails, regressions, bad contracts)

### Added
- **CLAUDE.md trigger** — testing setup maps to `directives/testing-strategy.md`

---

## [v1.16.0] — 2026-03-05

Restructured ROADMAP.md with new sections for better project planning visibility.

### Added
- **ROADMAP.md** — 4 new sections: Suggested Next (Claude's strategic recommendation), Must Plan (important items needing scoping), Claude Suggested Ideas (AI-pitched additions), plus HTML comment block with section rules for Claude
- **ROADMAP.md** — every entry now requires a `*(pitched/added DD/MM/YY)*` timestamp

### Changed
- **CLAUDE.md Rule 9** — pitch routing now specifies Ideas (casual) vs Must Plan (important) sections
- **ROADMAP.md** — description updated from "living notepad" to "sections flow from most concrete to most speculative"

---

## [v1.15.1] — 2026-03-05

Remove Last 10 Days leaderboard from /wrap.

### Removed
- **`/wrap` Part 8 (Last 10 Days Leaderboard)** -- entire section, template, rules, and `result.leaderboard` reference
- Leaderboard mention from README.md /wrap description

---

## [v1.15.0] — 2026-03-05

Card format cleanup and smart CLAUDE.md diffing across all DOE Kit-aware commands.

### Changed
- **`/stand-up` kick-off card** — removed BLOCKERS and LEARNINGS rows, PROJECT right-aligned on header row, added last-session SUMMARY above PLAN
- **`/stand-up` status card** — removed BLOCKERS and DECISIONS rows
- **`/eod` card** — removed Blockers from POSITION AT EOD section
- **DOE Kit sync check** (`/stand-up`, `/crack-on`, `/sitrep`, `/wrap`) — smart CLAUDE.md diff: only flags universal section changes (Operating Rules, Guardrails, Code Hygiene, Self-Annealing), ignores project-specific sections (Directory Structure, triggers)
- **`/crack-on`** — genericized project-specific example in header rule
- **README.md** — updated `/stand-up` description and DOE Kit awareness paragraph

---

## [v1.14.6] — 2026-03-05

New `/agent-start` command and simplified `/agent-launch` instructions.

### Added
- **`/agent-start` command** — claims a wave task, cd's into the worktree, shows the assignment, and starts working. Replaces manual `python3 multi_agent.py --claim` + `cd` workflow.

### Changed
- **`/agent-launch` instructions** — "go" output now shows `/agent-start` instead of manual python3 commands. Cleaner onboarding for new terminals.

---

## [v1.14.5] — 2026-03-05

Docs update: command count and wrap system checks heading.

### Fixed
- **Command count** — README claimed 15/22 commands; actual count is 27. Updated both READMEs with missing commands: `/agent-launch`, `/codemap`, `/doe-health`, `/review`, `/pull-doe`
- **Wrap system checks heading** — Added `🔍 SYSTEM CHECKS` section heading before the bordered audit/DOE Kit box

---

## [v1.14.4] — 2026-03-05

Round 4 fix: session ID resolution for all commands.

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: --complete/--fail/--abandon session resolution** — `--parent-pid` now auto-reads `.session-id-{pid}` file and sets `_session_override` in `main()`, so ALL commands resolve the correct session ID. Previously only `--claim` and hooks could find the session.
- **agent-launch instructions** — ALL multi_agent.py commands now include `--parent-pid $PPID` (claim, complete, fail, abandon)

---

## [v1.14.3] — 2026-03-05

Round 3 fix: per-terminal isolation via Claude Code PID.

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Session ID isolation (take 3)** — per-terminal files using Claude Code PID (`os.getppid()` in hooks, `$PPID` in Bash). Each terminal gets `.session-id-{pid}`, `.last-heartbeat-{pid}`, `.context-usage-{pid}.json`, `.context-warned-{pid}`. Solves the two-directory problem: hooks stay in project root, coordination files stay in project root, but each terminal's markers are isolated.
- **Wave completion cleanup** — glob-based cleanup of all PID-specific marker files (`*.session-id-*`, etc.)
- **agent-launch draft wave** — wave file written to `.draft-wave.json` (dotfile) until user approves, then moved to `wave-{N}.json`. Prevents orphaned wave files if session crashes before approval.
- **Wave file filtering** — `find_active_wave`/`find_latest_wave` now skip dotfiles (draft waves)
- **agent-launch instructions** — claim command now includes `--parent-pid $PPID` and explicit cd-to-worktree step

### Added
- **`--parent-pid` CLI arg** — passes Claude Code PID to `--claim` for session-id file naming

---

## [v1.14.2] — 2026-03-05

Round 2 adversarial review fixes + new `/agent-launch` command.

### Fixed
- **Reclaim log accuracy** — captures task-to-session mapping before modifying claims, so log entries attribute the correct stale session to each task
- **Context monitor glob** — matches all wave file names (not just `wave-*.json`), so budget detection works with custom waveIds like `comparison-filter`

### Added
- **`/agent-launch` command** — reads todo.md Queue, builds wave file, runs preview, launches on approval
- **Failed task retry docs** — documented that failed tasks are intentionally retryable (not terminal state)

---

## [v1.14.1] — 2026-03-05

Should-fix multi-agent bugs from adversarial review.

### Fixed
- **Reclaim** — preserves worktree branch (`delete_branch=False`) so new session can continue partial work
- **Wave sort** — `find_active_wave`/`find_latest_wave` use numeric index extraction instead of string sort (fixes wave-10 sorting before wave-2)
- **Validation dedup** — `cmd_validate` now delegates to `_analyze_wave` internally, eliminating ~100 lines of duplicated logic

### Added
- **`--fail` subcommand** — marks a task as failed with optional `--reason`, keeps worktree+branch for debugging, logs failure event

---

## [v1.14.0] — 2026-03-05

Critical multi-agent bug fixes from adversarial review.

### Fixed
- **Heartbeat hook** — uses fixed marker file (not per-PID) and reads session ID from `.tmp/.session-id` written by `--claim`
- **Context monitor** — corrected field names (`claimedTask`/`taskId` instead of `currentTask`/`id`), reads session ID from file instead of PID matching
- **Merge command** — auto-detects default branch (`master`/`main`) instead of hardcoding `master`

### Added
- `--claim` now writes `.tmp/.session-id` for hooks to read consistent session identity

---

## [v1.13.10] — 2026-03-05

Visual-explainer Progressive Disclosure triggers.

### Added
- 3 new triggers in CLAUDE.md: suggest `/diff-review` before commits, `/project-recap` after absence, `/plan-review` for alignment checks

---

## [v1.13.9] — 2026-03-05

Hook templates and pre-commit audit sweep.

### Added
- `hook-templates/javascript.json` — Claude Code hook template: warns on `console.log` and non-strict equality (`==`/`!=`) in JS/TS files
- `hook-templates/python.json` — Claude Code hook template: warns on bare exception catching and `shell=True` in subprocess calls
- `hook-templates/universal.json` — reference doc for hooks already included in the kit
- Pre-commit audit sweep — warnings (non-blocking) for `console.log` in JS/TS, bare `TODO` without reference, hardcoded localhost URLs
- Hook Templates section in CUSTOMIZATION.md — explains activation process

---

## [v1.13.8] — 2026-03-05

/doe-health diagnostic command.

### Added
- `/doe-health` command — 8-point integrity check (required files, CLAUDE.md line count, Progressive Disclosure targets, commands, hooks, git hooks, STATE.md freshness, kit version). Report only, never modifies.

---

## [v1.13.7] — 2026-03-05

/codemap command and /wrap structural change detection.

### Added
- `/codemap` command — generates `.claude/codemap.md` with project structure, key files, data flow, and active patterns
- `/wrap` step 8 — detects new/moved/deleted files and prompts to run /codemap

---

## [v1.13.6] — 2026-03-05

Self-annealing enhancement — root cause analysis and structured format for significant failures.

### Changed
- **Self-Annealing** section in CLAUDE.md — added "diagnose WHY" step, two-tier format (routine one-liners vs structured significant failures)
- **learnings.md** template — added structured failure format with What/Root cause/Fix/Prevention fields

---

## [v1.13.5] — 2026-03-05

Language best practices directives — prevention-over-detection guides for common agent failure modes.

### Added
- `directives/best-practices/javascript.md` — strict equality, async error handling, XSS prevention, cleanup patterns
- `directives/best-practices/python.md` — specific exceptions, mutable defaults, pathlib, injection prevention
- `directives/best-practices/html-css.md` — accessibility, semantic HTML, CSS custom properties, no inline styles
- `directives/best-practices/react.md` — dependency arrays, state immutability, derived state, cleanup effects

---

## [v1.13.4] — 2026-03-05

Architectural invariants directive — non-negotiable truths that survive any refactor.

### Added
- `directives/architectural-invariants.md` — 10 invariants covering DOE architecture, session integrity, safety, and extensibility. Includes escalation process when changes would violate an invariant.
- Progressive Disclosure trigger for architectural changes

---

## [v1.13.3] — 2026-03-05

/review command — adversarial code review via subagent.

### Added
- `/review` command — reads git diff, checks security/correctness/dead code/breaking changes/contract compliance, outputs PASS/PASS WITH NOTES/FAIL with structured findings. Advisory only, never modifies files.

---

## [v1.13.2] — 2026-03-05

Task contracts — testable completion criteria for non-trivial todo.md steps.

### Added
- **Task contract format** in todo.md format rules — `Contract:` block with verifiable criteria. Prevents premature "done" marking on complex steps.

---

## [v1.13.1] — 2026-03-05

CLAUDE.md enrichments — identity reframe, research separation, sycophancy-aware verification, subagent context savings, and best practices trigger.

### Changed
- **Who We Are** — reframed from role-specific ("non-technical founder") to generic ("human defines intent, Claude builds")
- **Rule 2** — added research/implementation separation guidance for significant research tasks (3+ approaches)
- **Rule 4** — added sycophancy-aware evaluation: use neutral verification prompts, not leading questions
- **Rule 7** — added concrete context savings numbers (15k tokens → 500-token summary = 30x saving)

### Added
- Progressive Disclosure trigger: read language best practices directives before writing code

---

## [v1.13.0] — 2026-03-05

Added /pull-doe — the reverse of /sync-doe. Pulls kit updates into a project with version-aware diffing, file categorization, and safe merging.

### Added
- `/pull-doe` command — reverse sync (kit → project) with version-aware diffing, analysis box, and result summary
- `directives/starter-kit-pull.md` — 15-step pull procedure with file categorization (global installs, hooks, CLAUDE.md, templates, directives, execution scripts)
- Progressive Disclosure trigger for starter-kit-pull directive

### Changed
- `/sync-doe` — added cross-reference to `/pull-doe` for reverse direction

---

## [v1.12.7] — 2026-03-05

Upgraded /crack-on to bordered card format matching stand-up, sitrep, and other commands.

### Changed
- `/crack-on`: full bordered card with project in header, feature, progress bar, DOE Kit status, picking-up step with plain English summary, and model row
- `/crack-on`: removed separate model check paragraph — now integrated into card

---

## [v1.12.6] — 2026-03-05

Bordered card alignment fix and bidirectional DOE sync detection across all 8 global command files.

### Changed
- All bordered commands: explicit `line()` helper pattern in BORDER rules — prevents header misalignment
- All bordered commands: mandate "never construct `f"│{...}│"` manually" in generation rules
- 5 commands: bidirectional sync detection (inbound tag comparison + outbound file diff, not just file diff)
- Files: commands, crack-on, eod, sitrep, stand-up, sync-doe, vitals, wrap

---

## [v1.12.5] — 2026-03-05

Model allocation rules — plans and subagents must specify which model and thinking level to use.

### Changed
- Rule 1: plans must include recommended model + thinking level per step
- Rule 7: subagents must use deliberate model selection (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku)
- `/sitrep`: DOE KIT diff wording fix ("check" vs "count")

---

## [v1.12.4] — 2026-03-04

Standardised DOE sync status format across all 6 global commands. Compact notation replaces verbose text.

### Changed
- DOE sync status: compact `*` format across `/commands`, `/crack-on`, `/sitrep`, `/stand-up`, `/vitals`, `/wrap`
- Synced state: bare version (no tick, no "synced" text)
- Unsynced state: `vX.Y.Z *` (asterisk suffix)
- `/stand-up` WARNINGS: omit section when all PASS (was showing "None ✓")

---

## [v1.12.3] — 2026-03-04

Compressed CLAUDE.md from 117 to 83 lines by moving Break Glass to a directive and tightening 3 rules. Overhauled /sitrep.

### Added
- `directives/break-glass.md` — emergency recovery procedure (extracted from CLAUDE.md)
- Progressive Disclosure trigger for break-glass directive
- `/sitrep` COMPLETED section — cumulative session work log
- `/sitrep` push status indicator (pushed/committed)
- `/sitrep` DOE version in header row

### Changed
- CLAUDE.md compressed: Rule 1 (planning), Rule 8 (pre-commit checks), hook response format (117 → 83 lines)
- `/sitrep` reordered: ACTIVE shown first, DONE second, PENDING renamed to UP NEXT (capped at 5)
- `/sitrep` box auto-stretches to fit content instead of truncating
- `directives/starter-kit-sync.md` — Steps 7 and 9 now require bordered boxes (diff summary + changelog) for approval

### Removed
- Break Glass section from CLAUDE.md (moved to directive)
- `/sitrep` BLOCKERS, QUEUE, and DOE KIT rows (DOE version moved to header)

## [v1.12.2] — 2026-03-04

### Added
- **`/sync-doe` analysis box** — new required Analysis Box section showing a bordered diff summary with header (version right-aligned), context summary, numbered file list, verdict, and recommendation. Displayed before proposing changes so the user can approve or reject from a clear overview.

---

## [v1.12.1] — 2026-03-04

### Added
- **Universal learnings template** — added 3 Shell & Platform entries (emoji box-drawing, zsh nullglob, `$$` subshell PID), new Hooks & Session Files section (orphan file prevention), new Output section (single-block assembly, re-present script output as text). Template now has 6 sections and 11 learnings.

---

## [v1.12.0] — 2026-03-04

### Changed
- **`/commands` reference** — updated from 15 to 22 commands. Added `/fact-check` to Quality section. Added new Visual section with 6 commands: `/project-recap`, `/diff-review`, `/plan-review`, `/generate-visual-plan`, `/generate-web-diagram`, `/generate-slides`.

---

## [v1.11.8] — 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- **`/sync-doe` result box** — replaced hardcoded box width with dynamic computation (`W = max(len(line)) + 4`). Long summary lines no longer break the right border.

---

## [v1.11.7] — 2026-03-04

### Changed
- **`/wrap` layout** — moved NEXT UP section to render after the footer (was between Decisions and Numbers). Renumbered parts 6-9.

---

## [v1.11.6] — 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- **Session timer** — replaced per-PID `.session-start-$$` with single `.tmp/.session-start` file across 6 commands (`/stand-up`, `/crack-on`, `/sitrep`, `/wrap`, `/eod`, `/commands`). `$$` returned a different subshell PID per Bash tool call, making the timer unreliable. Worktrees handle multi-session isolation, so per-PID files were unnecessary.

---

## [v1.11.5] — 2026-03-04

### Changed
- **Box-drawing rules** — clarified in 5 global commands (`/audit`, `/sitrep`, `/stand-up`, `/sync-doe`, `/wrap`): explicitly use Unicode box-drawing characters (`┌─┐`, `├─┤`, `└─┘`, `│`) for borders, ASCII-only for content inside borders

---

## [v1.11.4] — 2026-03-04

### Changed
- **Commands README** — updated from 15 to 22 commands, added Visual category (`/project-recap`, `/diff-review`, `/plan-review`, `/generate-visual-plan`, `/generate-web-diagram`, `/generate-slides`), added `/fact-check` to Quality, reorganised table layout

---

## [v1.11.3] — 2026-03-04

### Changed
- **`/audit` result box** — output now ends with a programmatic bordered result box (matching `/sync-doe` and `/wrap` style) showing PASS/WARN/FAIL counts and key stats

---

## [v1.11.2] — 2026-03-04

### Added
- **`/wrap` agents stat** — new "agents spawned" metric in The Numbers section, counted from Agent tool calls in the session

### Changed
- **`/wrap` session time label** — shortened from "total session time" to "session time"
- **`/wrap` system checks box** — replaced hand-padded example boxes with programmatic generation instruction (collect lines, find max length, `.ljust()`)

### Removed
- **`/wrap` One-Stat Highlight** — removed Part 9 (redundant with The Numbers). Parts renumbered from 11 to 10.

---

## [v1.11.1] — 2026-03-04

### Changed
- **`/wrap` title card** — project name now uses spaced-out uppercase text (e.g. `M O N T Y`) centered in the box, generated from the current directory name. Narrative lines render as plain paragraphs below the code fence (no indentation).
- **`/wrap` output** — removed haiku section. Parts renumbered from 12 to 11. Narrative sections (vibe, journey, commits, decisions, next up) now appear before data tables (numbers, timeline, leaderboard).

---

## [v1.11.0] — 2026-03-04

### Added
- **7 new universal commands:** `diff-review.md` (visual HTML diff review), `fact-check.md` (verify doc accuracy against codebase), `generate-slides.md` (magazine-quality HTML slide decks), `generate-visual-plan.md` (visual HTML implementation plans), `generate-web-diagram.md` (standalone HTML diagrams), `plan-review.md` (visual HTML plan review), `project-recap.md` (visual HTML project recap).

---

## [v1.10.2] — 2026-03-04

### Changed
- **`sync-doe.md` result box templates** — moved status emojis above the box as standalone signal lines (e.g. `✅ SYNCED` before the bordered box). Emojis stay visible for quick-glance scanning without breaking box-drawing alignment.

---

## [v1.10.1] — 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- **`sync-doe.md` result box templates** — removed emojis from inside bordered boxes (they render double-width, breaking alignment). Added programmatic box generation rule and ASCII-only constraint matching other commands.

---

## [v1.10.0] — 2026-03-04

### Changed
- **Per-PID session timers for multi-terminal safety.** Session clock files changed from `.tmp/.session-start` to `.tmp/.session-start-$$` (shell PID). Each terminal gets an independent timer. Stale PID files are pruned on `/crack-on`, `/stand-up`, and `/wrap` via `kill -0` checks. `/eod` scans all PID files to detect multiple active sessions. Updated all 6 command files: `crack-on.md`, `stand-up.md`, `sitrep.md`, `wrap.md`, `eod.md`, `commands.md`.
- **Progress bar border exception** in `stand-up.md` — `█` and `░` characters now explicitly permitted inside bordered boxes (they render at fixed width in terminals).

---

## [v1.9.4] — 2026-03-04

### Added
- **Code Hygiene rule: plans go in the project.** New CLAUDE.md rule requiring plans to be written to the project's `.claude/plans/` directory with descriptive filenames, not to `~/.claude/plans/`. Prevents plan files from landing in the global directory where they're invisible to the project.

---

## [v1.9.3] — 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- **`wrap_stats.py` step counting** — `count_steps_completed_today()` counted all `[x]` steps with today's date, inflating `stepsCompleted` across multiple sessions on the same day. Replaced with `count_steps_completed_since()` which parses the `HH:MM DD/MM/YY` timestamp and only counts steps completed after the session start time.

---

## [v1.9.2] — 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- **`context_monitor.py` file accumulation** — replaced per-PID tracker files (`.context-{pid}.json`) with a single `.context-usage.json` that gets overwritten each tool call. Prevents hundreds of orphan files accumulating in `.tmp/` per session. Same fix applied to warn marker (`.context-warned-{pid}` → `.context-warned`).

---

## [v1.9.1] — 2026-03-04

### Added
- **`copy_plan_to_project.py` hook** — PostToolUse hook that auto-copies plans written to `~/.claude/plans/` into the current project's `.claude/plans/` directory. Fires after `write|edit` tool calls targeting `~/.claude/plans/*.md`.
- **PostToolUse section in `settings.json`** — registers the plan-copy hook

---

## [v1.9.0] — 2026-03-04

### Changed
- **Multi-agent system moved to global install** — no more per-project copies. `multi_agent.py` → `~/.claude/scripts/`, `heartbeat.py` + `context_monitor.py` → `~/.claude/hooks/`, `/hq` → `~/.claude/commands/`. Install once, works across all projects.
- **`setup.sh` extended** — 3 new install sections: hooks to `~/.claude/hooks/`, scripts to `~/.claude/scripts/`, merges PostToolUse into `~/.claude/settings.json`
- **Path refactor** — all multi-agent Python files use `Path.cwd()` instead of `Path(__file__)` for global execution
- **`--project-root` override** — `multi_agent.py` accepts `--project-root DIR` to specify the project directory explicitly
- **Template `.claude/settings.json` now PreToolUse-only** — PostToolUse hooks are merged into the global settings by `setup.sh`

---

## [v1.8.0] — 2026-03-04

### Added
- **Multi-agent coordination system** — `execution/multi_agent.py` for running 2-4 parallel Claude Code sessions. Wave management, task claiming, session registry, heartbeats, merge protocol, cost tracking. All state in `.tmp/waves/`.
- **`/hq` command** — `.claude/commands/hq.md` project-level dashboard. Shows wave status, terminal liveness, task progress, cost estimates, merge order. Modes: no_wave (help), active (live dashboard).
- **Heartbeat hook** — `.claude/hooks/heartbeat.py` PostToolUse hook updating session liveness every 30s during active waves. Stale sessions (>2 min) are detectable and reclaimable.
- **Context monitor hook** — `.claude/hooks/context_monitor.py` PostToolUse hook tracking estimated context usage. Warns at 60%, stops at 80% for graceful handoff. Model-aware budgets during waves (haiku: 30k, sonnet: 80k, opus: 200k).
- **Active wave audit check** — `check_active_wave` in `audit_claims.py` warns when a wave is active and results may be incomplete until merge. Runs in fast/hook mode.
- **PostToolUse hooks in settings.json** — heartbeat and context monitor fire after every tool use

---

## [v1.7.4] — 2026-03-03

### Removed
- **`/wrap`** — removed fortune cookie line from session footer. Adds noise without value.

---

## [v1.7.3] — 2026-03-03

### Changed
- **`/stand-up` (status mode)** — reordered card: PHASE GOAL now appears above PROGRESS for better readability. Added NEXT STEP line showing the first uncompleted step from todo.md, so the immediate task is always visible at a glance.

---

## [v1.7.2] — 2026-03-03

### Fixed
- **`execution/audit_claims.py`** — skip version tag WARN for `[INFRA]` tasks. Infrastructure features don't bump app version, so their todo steps never have version tags. `parse_completed_tasks()` now tracks heading context and `check_task_format()` skips the check for `[INFRA]` sections.

---

## [v1.7.0] — 2026-03-02

### Changed
- **`/wrap`** — lightweight rewrite. Removed scoring/badges/genre system. One dramatic narrative (no genre selection), added session haiku, one-stat highlight, fortune cookie footer. Leaderboard now shows commits/lines instead of scores. Vibe check determined inline instead of by script.
- **`/roast`** — removed score trend and badge pattern analysis bullets (stats.json no longer has these fields)
- **`/stand-up`** — removed "score trends" FOCUS bullet
- **`/eod`** — removed SCORE line from card, simplified session list to title + duration (no scores/badges)
- **`/commands`** — updated `/wrap` and `/roast` descriptions to reflect lightweight wrap

### Removed
- Scoring formula, badge definitions, genre selection, multiplier system, high score tracking from `/wrap`
- `execution/wrap_stats.py` scoring logic (978 → ~150 lines, now metrics + streak only)

---

## [v1.6.0] — 2026-03-02

### Added
- **`/eod`** — new end-of-day report command. Aggregates all sessions, commits, features, and position into one bordered summary. Shows day stats, session list, semantic "What Got Done" grouping, position at EOD, and day vibe.
- **`execution/wrap_stats.py`** — new deterministic scoring script (978 lines). Handles all session scoring computation: git metrics, streak, multiplier, raw/final score, badge evaluation (with once-per-day dedup), high score check, leaderboard consolidation. Outputs JSON for the `/wrap` prompt to render.

### Changed
- **`/stand-up`** — added WARNINGS section (surfaces audit WARN/FAIL findings in kick-off card with detail lines and "Fix now?" suggestions) and FOCUS section (2-3 coaching bullets from `stats.json` analysis: infra/product ratio, stale WARNs, commits/session trends, steps completed, time-of-day patterns, score trends)
- **`/vitals`** — added mandatory audit detail lines rule: WARN/FAIL items must each be shown on indented detail lines, using `--json` flag for reliable parsing
- **`/roast`** — added "And you..." developer habit analysis section: roasts session timing, infra/product ratio, score trends, badge patterns, commits/session, steps throughput, and streak from `stats.json`
- **`/wrap`** — rewrote to delegate all scoring computation to `execution/wrap_stats.py`. Steps 2+3 replaced with single script call. Display sections now reference `result.*` JSON fields. Prompt reduced from ~22K to ~17K chars.

---

## [v1.5.0] — 2026-03-02

### Changed
- **`/stand-up`** — rewritten as context-aware dual-mode command. Detects `.tmp/.session-start`: **kick-off mode** (no session) starts clock, reads project state, shows bordered card with plan, waits for sign-off. **Status mode** (session active) shows bordered daily status card with progress, momentum, activity since last milestone, blockers, pending decisions, and queue. Read-only in status mode.
- **`/commands`** — updated `/stand-up` description for dual-mode, updated smart filter section
- **Reference docs** — updated stand-up descriptions across README, SYSTEM-MAP, CUSTOMIZATION, and global-commands/README
- **CUSTOMIZATION** — corrected command count from 11 to 13 (added `/vitals`, `/commands` to list)

---

## [v1.4.0] — 2026-03-02

### Added
- **`/vitals`** — new workspace health check command: git status, quick audit, DOE Kit sync, STATE.md alignment, stale temp files. Bordered output with ✓/⚠️ per check.

### Changed
- **`/wrap`** — added quick audit to Step 1 housekeeping; replaced plain footer with bordered "System Checks" section showing audit results and DOE Kit sync status together
- **`/commands`** — updated to 13 commands, added `/vitals` under Quality category
- **README** — command count 12 → 13, added `/vitals` to Quality row in table
- **SYSTEM-MAP** — added vitals.md to file table, command reference, and directory tree

---

## [v1.3.0] — 2026-03-02

### Added
- **`setup.sh`** — one-command installer: copies commands to `~/.claude/commands/`, copies universal CLAUDE.md template (if none exists), activates git hooks, writes version receipt to `~/.claude/.doe-kit-version`
- **`/commands`** — new slash command replacing `/README`. Shows full command reference by category, checks installation status (missing commands), and checks GitHub for kit updates
- **Slash Commands section in README** — category table with smart filter explanation, links to `/commands` for full reference
- **Manual setup fallback** — collapsible details block in Quick Start for users who prefer not to use the script

### Changed
- Quick Start simplified from 6 steps to 3 (clone → `./setup.sh` → `/stand-up`)
- `global-commands/README.md` is now a short GitHub directory readme (no longer doubles as a command)
- Command count updated from 11 → 12 across README and command reference

### Removed
- `/README` command — replaced by `/commands`

---

## [v1.2.1] — 2026-03-01

### Changed
- `/sync-doe` now shows a bordered result summary box at the end of every sync — `✅ SYNCED`, `⏭️ NO CHANGES`, `❌ REJECTED`, or `⚠️ BLOCKED` with explanation and kit version

---

## [v1.2.0] — 2026-03-01

### Added
- **CLAUDE.md Rule 10: Parallelise by default** — automatically spawn sub-agents for independent tasks, flag sequential dependencies, commit one-at-a-time per Rule 6
- **CLAUDE.md Guardrail: Protect starter kit** — blocks direct edits to `~/doe-starter-kit`; all changes must go through `/sync-doe`

### Changed
- Renamed `/sync-kit` to `/sync-doe` across all files — command name, file (`sync-doe.md`), and 40+ references in 10 files. Better describes syncing DOE framework improvements.

---

## [v1.1.1] — 2026-02-28

### Added
- `/wrap` footer now shows DOE Kit version and sync status as the last line before closing

---

## [v1.1.0] — 2026-02-28

### Added
- **DOE Kit awareness** — `/stand-up`, `/crack-on`, `/sitrep`, and `/wrap` now check `~/doe-starter-kit` if it exists
- `/stand-up` and `/crack-on` show kit version + pending change count at session start
- `/sitrep` shows `DOE KIT` row with version and sync status
- `/wrap` nudges `/sync-doe` when DOE files have changed since last sync
- All four commands recommend `/sync-doe` when pending changes are detected

---

## [v1.0.0] — 2026-02-28

Initial release. 40 files across 8 directories.

### Added
- **CLAUDE.md** — 9 operating rules, guardrails, progressive disclosure triggers, directory structure
- **STATE.md** — Session memory template
- **ROADMAP.md** — Product roadmap template
- **SYSTEM-MAP.md** — Complete file-by-file documentation and relationship map
- **CUSTOMIZATION.md** — Guide for adapting the kit to new projects
- **Directives** — `_TEMPLATE.md`, `documentation-governance.md`, `claim-auditing.md`, `starter-kit-sync.md`
- **Execution** — `audit_claims.py` with universal checks and project extension point
- **11 slash commands** — `/stand-up`, `/crack-on`, `/wrap` (gamified), `/sitrep`, `/sync-doe`, `/pitch`, `/audit`, `/quick-audit`, `/roast`, `/eli5`, `/shower-thought`
- **Guardrail hooks** — `block_dangerous_commands.py`, `block_secrets_in_code.py`, `protect_directives.py`
- **Git hooks** — `commit-msg` (strip AI co-author trailers), `pre-commit` (fast audit)
- **Session timer** — `/stand-up` and `/crack-on` start clock, `/sitrep` and `/wrap` report duration
- **Gamification** — Scoring, badges, streaks, leaderboard, themed wrap-up cards
- **README.md** — Quick start guide and feature overview

### Fixed
- `commit-msg` hook uses macOS-compatible `sed -i ''` syntax
- `/sitrep` STATUS field has clearer instruction wording
- `/wrap` score table has separate high score / non-high score templates with `d[streak]` multiplier format

### Changed
- `/sync-doe` includes up-to-date check — stops early if nothing to sync
- Sync directive includes safety guardrails: pull-before-compare, three-way diff, additive merging, git stash backup
